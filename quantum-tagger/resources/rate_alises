Hole #1This hole is a straightaway par 4 that measures 429 yards from the blue tees. Rated as one of the toughest holes in Southern California, mid-to-high handicappers should hit a high percentage tee shot and play the hole as a short par 5. Long ball hitters should favor the left side. The ball will kick to the right, so you may want to add a half to full club for an uphill approach shot. X 1	13

Hole #1 This hole is a straightaway par 4 that measures 429 yards from the blue tees. Rated as one of the toughest holes in Southern California, mid-to-high handicappers should hit a high percentage tee shot and play the hole as a short par 5. Long ball hitters should favor the left side. The ball will kick to the right, so you may want to add a half to full club for an uphill approach shot. X 1	1

Notes: 1. Rates/equations used to calculate the above thresholds are from Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, 2003, by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. This table will likely need updating as future editions provide additional information. 2. For example, a full traffic impact study should be completed (100 peak hour, peak direction trips generated) if 150 or more single family units are proposed for a site. 3. GLA – Gross Leasable Area; GFA – Gross Floor Area. 4. Using AM peak-hour rates/equations would provide a lower threshold. However, adjacent roadway volumes are usually higher during the PM peak hour. 5. Uses both “Service Station with Market” and “Convenience Market with Pumps” data. 6. For further trip generation characteristics of the above land uses, or of other uses not illustrated above, refer to the latest version of Trip Generation.	1

Header offset * 512 in length This consist of a number of variables providing additional quantitative and qualitative values. Most are obvious from their descriptors in square brackets []. The ones of particular interest are: [NumChans] [Label] [SamRate] Lines are terminated with In detail, each variable is represented in the header by: 1 The variable's identifying name. This consists of as many as 11 characters enclosed by square brackets. The left bracket must be in the first column. In reading the variable's name, leading and trailing blanks are removed, case is ignored, and control characters are removed. 2 A description of the variable. This is indicated by desc=3D followed by as many as 39 characters 3 The dimensions of the compressed array in the form: dimensions=3D dim1 dim2. The first dimension equals the number of channels, or else 1 (if the value is the same for each channel). The second dimension equals the number of segments, or else 1 (if the value is the same for each segment). 4 The data type in the form: type=3Ddata_type, where data_type can be any of the types defined in ac_set.h under enum FIELDTYPE. This item is optional, as there are very likely correct defaults set by any program that reads these data files. 5 An introduction to the array list: weight+value=3D. 6 The array of weights and values. There should be dim1 x dim2 lines. The values for segment 0 are listed first, then for segment 1, and so on. Each line consists of a weight and a value. The weight may be 0, in which case, no value is present or necessary. Otherwise the weight is >0 and a value is specified. The value may be of any of the various types recognised by this set of programs - see item 4. There is a function decode() that decodes any of these standard formats. Concerning weights, for string and boolean variables, there is no useful distinction between weights of 1 and >1. However for numeric variables, the value of weight is important when combining data sets. Then it is necessary to form weighted averages, hence the importance of including a weight with each value. The variables may be arranged in any order within the header, with the exception of the two variables NumChans and NumSegs that MUST precede any multidimensional variable. This is because with such array-type variables, one or both of the two dimensions specified in item 3 will be >1 and MUST match NumChans or NumSegs. Finally, within the header part of the data file, blank lines may be inserted anywhere, and are skipped when reading the file. Also, from the end of the header to the beginning of the binary data there is a variable number of tilde (~) characters. They are inserted as padding, in order that the binary data begins on an IO block boundary (multiple of 512 bytes).	1

APRAPR is very critical to understanding the embedded costs at any mortgage company. APR may be thought of simply in this way: The Payment calculated using your Interest Rate and the total of: your base Loan Amount plus All Costs associated with attaining a Loan is Exactly Equal to the Payment calculated using the APR Interest Rate and your base Loan Amount alone. APR then, is really just a fancy and semi-uniform way to summarize the contribution of all costs as they relate to Payment.	1

APR layer close Annual percentage rate (APR) The annual cost of a loan to a borrower. Like an interest rate, the APR is expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. Unlike an interest rate, however, it includes other charges or fees to reflect the total cost of the loan. The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer loan agreement disclose the APR. Since all lenders must follow the same rules to ensure the accuracy of the APR, borrowers can use the APR as a good basis for comparing certain costs of loans. End of layer.	14

CLARK COUNTY ADVISORY QUESTION NO. 6 (12 out of 12 Precincts Reporting) This question is advisory only: Do you support Clark County seeking legislation to permit the County to create the Boulder City Hospital District to contract with the existing not-for-profit hospital in Boulder City and allow the District to impose a new property tax in the amount of 15 cents per 100 dollars of assessed valuation within the District, to fund capital improvements (updating or adding square footage to the physical plant and infrastructure, purchase of property, plant and equipment, as well as repayment of capital debt) and program expansions (i.e., financing the recruitment of needed physician specialties and adding new medical services not currently available within the District's boundaries)? If approved, the County will seek legislation that would allow only the new rate to be outside the caps on a taxpayer's liability for property taxes established by the Legislature in the 2005 session, but except for the effect of the increased tax rate, the taxes raised would not otherwise be outside these caps.	1

SFPD #4 (64 out of 64 Precincts Reporting) Shall the Sierra Fire Protection District be authorized to issue up to $5,200,000 of general obligation bonds for the purpose of defraying the cost of acquiring, constructing, improving and equipping fire stations and acquiring fire engines and fire fighting equipment and to levy an additional property tax rate for the purpose of staffing, operating, maintaining and equipping the fire stations and acquiring and improving fire engines and fire fighting equipment of up to 4.5 cents per $100 of assessed valuation for a period of 30 years? The bonds are expected to require a property tax levy for 30 years. The bonds are estimated to result in an increase in the property taxes that the owner of a new $100,000 home will pay, which will average $4.74 per year. In addition, the cost of the property tax levy for the owner of a new $100,000 home is estimated to be $15.75 per year. If this question is approved by the voters, any property tax levied as authorized by this question will be outside of the caps on a taxpayer's liability for property (ad valorem) taxes established by the legislature in the 2005 session.	1

The Bonds are expected to require a property tax levy for 20 years.

Our Lease Price Index (LPI) is an internally-generated business indicator that measures general lease rate pricing on renewals within our North American railcar fleet. We calculate the index using the weighted average lease rate for a group of railcar types that we believe best represents our overall North American fleet. In addition to our LPI, we use this representative group of North American railcars to calculate an average renewal lease rate change and an average renewal term. The average renewal lease rate change is the percentage change between the weighted average renewal lease rate and the weighted average expiring lease rate. The average renewal lease term index is reported in months. It reflects the average renewal lease term of railcar types in the LPI weighted by fleet composition.	1
