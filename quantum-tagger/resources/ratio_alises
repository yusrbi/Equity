B. Movement of sodium into the cell Rationale The QRS complex is indicative of ventricular depolarization. To depolarize, sodium rushes into the cell while potassium leaves, causing the originally negatively charged inner cell environment to become positive. Depolarization is followed by contraction of the myocardial cells and is responsible for the physical pumping of blood into the circulatory system. Ventricular repolarization describes the return of potassium to the inside of the cells and removal of sodium to the outside of the cell. Ventricular repolarization is evident on the ECG as the �T� wave and results in the inside of the cell regaining its negative charge and the outside its positive charge. Atrial depolarization occurs during the �P� wave of the ECG tracing. As stated, potassium leaves the cell during ventricular depolarization and does not enter it.	1

Will Braxton Miller be able to go this weekend? It appears so. Will he be 'Braxton Miller-like' however? We don't know that for sure. Will Miller be the runner that he has been in the past eight games? Will the staff left him run the way he has run in past games? The Buckeyes better have a 'Plan B' ready for either Miller passing or handing the ball off to No.'s 34 and 2 to keep the signal caller healthy and in the game for the duration. The Buckeyes have proven that they can still move the ball with Kenny Guiton under center but three series and a whole game are two different stories. Corey Brown continues to be the best option for moving the chains with Devin Smith as the deep threat but it has been feast or famine with Smith who can make the spectacular happen and then lose focus and drop an easy one. A lot has been made of Penn State's tight ends but Ohio State's tight ends will play a huge role here too. Will Jake Stoneburner be more than a blocker this time around and can Miller (or Guiton) find Jeff Heuerman or Nick Vannett for huge gains?	7

a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. b These drugs induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Other drugs which have similar effects include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin, or other drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen as that used with anticonvulsants that have this effect.	6

Will Braxton Miller be able to go this weekend? It appears so. Will he be 'Braxton Miller-like' however? We don't know that for sure. Will Miller be the runner that he has been in the past eight games? Will the staff left him run the way he has run in past games? The Buckeyes better have a 'Plan B' ready for either Miller passing or handing the ball off to No.'s 34 and 2 to keep the signal caller healthy and in the game for the duration. The Buckeyes have proven that they can still move the ball with Kenny Guiton under center but three series and a whole game are two different stories. Corey Brown continues to be the best option for moving the chains with Devin Smith as the deep threat but it has been feast or famine with Smith who can make the spectacular happen and then lose focus and drop an easy one. A lot has been made of Wisconsin's tight ends but Ohio State's tight ends will play a huge role here too. Will Jake Stoneburner be more than a blocker this time around and can Miller (or Guiton) find Jeff Heuerman or Nick Vannett for huge gains?	5

Green Is Good, Red Is Bad Councilors dealt with the city’s 22-year-old food sanitation ordinance and replaced it with an amended Food and Drug Administration-approved version. The changes bring the city’s code up to FDA standards. A key change for small businesses is an increase in fees for restaurant and food-production permits. The fees raise city revenue and allow the hiring of three more inspectors, which would bring the total number of city health inspectors to eight. The measure passed.	5

Preserving Richard Neutra's VDL Studio/Residences in Los Angeles Over the past thirty-five years, Raymond Richard Neutra, the youngest son of famous modernist architect Richard Neutra, has explored the world, connecting with his father’s buildings and creating relationships with their owners and occupants. Through his travels, Raymond had the opportunity to better understand his father’s international legacy. On October 4, 2012 Triangle Modernist Houses will host Raymond Neutra, for a talk about one of his father’s famous American legacies and personal home, the VDL Studio/Residences in Los Angeles, California. The VDL compound has seen ongoing efforts of restoration since the 1990s. Raymond will describe the philosophical issues encountered during the project as well as its current progress.	4

Intent locks: Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server locking is fully automatic and does not require intervention by users. Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server applies exclusive locks for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. When an exclusive lock is set, no other transaction can obtain any type of lock on those objects until the original lock is in place. For non-update or read operations, a shared lock is applied. If a shared lock is applied to a table or a page, other transactions can also obtain a shared lock on that table or page. However, no transaction can obtain an exclusive lock. Therefore, Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server reads block the modifications to the data. Extent locks: Extent locks lock a group of eight database pages while they are being allocated or freed. These locks are held during a CREATE or DROP statement, or during an INSERT that requires new data or index pages. A list of active locks for the current server can be seen with SP_LOCK system procedure.	4

Money Talks Councilors were tasked with taking a stand against the 2010 Citizens United decision. The Supreme Court's opinion eliminated restrictions on corporate and union spending intended to defeat or advocate for a political candidate. Corporations and unions cannot give money directly to campaigns, but they can form super PACs to buy ads. Garduño proposed a resolution calling on Congress to overturn the ruling, a move supported by 79 percent of the country.	3

Jeanne Pahls said the document did not acknowledge the 2,510 weapons of mass destruction stored on Kirtland Air Force Base.

The second gives another extension to property owners that have not brought homes into compliance with the zoning code imposed in 1959. The deadline has been extended many times and was set for March 28. The latest extension tacks on three more months.	3

'Mela' is a Sanskrit word meaning 'gathering' or 'to meet' or a Fair. It is used in the Subcontinent for all sizes of gathering and can be religious, commercial, or cultural. Traditionally Mela means 'Village Fair'. ‘The Mela’ held each year in the heart of London celebrates and shares the culture of London's multi racial communities. It is a feast of sights, sounds, smells and tastes featuring bazaars, folk troupes, traditional and contemporary British & Ethnic music and dance. Started life in 1992, it is the first of its kind to be held in London involving local organisations, community groups, schools, colleges, and institutions such as the British Museum and the British Library. From its humble beginnings as a small Bangladeshi community festival, it has been dubbed as ‘The Camden Mela’, ‘The Regent’s Park Mela’, ‘The Central London Mela’, and for obvious reasons ‘The Bangladesh Mela’. The Mela has grown to such an extent that it represents an opportunity for the wider communities to get together, regardless of their background, and work towards a festive occasion through involvement in various educational and arts projects that promote appreciation and understanding of various cultures in one of the world's greatest multicultural city. The Mela uses arts to challenge the negative perceptions of multiculturalism; it aims to breakdown the barriers to give way to social inclusion, integration, and harmony whilst appreciating diversity for a healthy society. Serving as an ideal outlet the Mela showcases the outcome of activities carried out throughout the year by the schoolchildren, teachers and their parents as well as the youth organisations and community centres in Central London. All in all, it culminates into a spectacular event for all ages to enjoy in the height of the British summer organised by the Mela committee in association with Camden Council, Royal Parks, British Land and the British Museum.	3

Arena Talk Councilors Isaac Benton, Ken Sanchez and O’Malley introduced a resolution telling Mayor Richard Berry to work with Albuquerque Public Schools on sharing the First Baptist Church property at Central and Broadway in East Downtown. The city has its eye on the lot as a possible location for an arena. APS is looking to buy the property for a magnet charter school for the performing arts. APS has said it does not need the entire piece of property. The councilors’ proposal says the administration needs to take another serious look at a compromise: APS gets the east end, and the city gets the west end for a potential sports and entertainment arena to anchor more economic development Downtown.	3

In 1587, at Coutras, Henry of Navarre gained a brilliant victory over the forces of the League; but the city of Paris was fanatically devoted to Guise, and while the south of France held with Navarre, the north was with the League, and the king so bitterly hated Guise as to have him assassinated (in 1588) in his own chamber, to rid himself of his overbearing dominion; but the effect was the furious exasperation of the League and the citizens of Paris, who tore down the royal arms, renounced their allegiance, and declared Henry an excommunicated heretic.	3

Hey! Who's Your Estimator? People living near the Rio Grande Zoo protested the administration's alleged decision to eliminate a planned parking garage, saying that zoo visitors were parking in their yards and driveways. Speakers said the administration had allocated $5 million for the garage, spent $1.1 million of it elsewhere, and now considered the garage, recently estimated at $12 million, too expensive. Speaker Ron Romero said the language of the project specified that money be spent on a multilevel parking facility, streetscape and street planning.	3

Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server locking is fully automatic and does not require intervention by users. Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server applies exclusive locks for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. When an exclusive lock is set, no other transaction can obtain any type of lock on those objects until the original lock is in place. For non-update or read operations, a shared lock is applied. If a shared lock is applied to a table or a page, other transactions can also obtain a shared lock on that table or page. However, no transaction can obtain an exclusive lock. Therefore, Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server reads block the modifications to the data. Update locks: Update locks are held at the page level. They are placed during the initial stages of an update operation when the pages are being read. Update locks can coexist with shared locks. If the pages are changed later, the update locks are escalated to exclusive locks.	3

O'Malley versus the Two Towers Councilor O'Malley tried to put a resolution on the agenda requiring the administration to comply with existing city policy on funding two 65-foot towers. The towers will be erected at the I-40 and Rio Grande intersection to commemorate the city's Tricentennial. O'Malley said the towers' original $370,000 cost had risen to $843,000, and that the Council was supposed to review art project funding. Chief Operating Officer Ed Adams said the art project had acquired more artwork, walls and lighting, and that material costs had risen.	3

Pony Up to Tee Up Mike Daniels, chair of the Golf Advisory Board, said the city's courses are in dismal shape and getting worse. While the courses are expected to pay for themselves, they are losing money and unable to pay for proper soil treatment or repair and replacement of equipment. Council President Debbie O'Malley spoke of touring one course and seeing a dozen dissected lawn mowers, cannibalized by workers for parts to get just one mower working. Sanchez sponsored an administration bill raising green fees by about two dollars.	2

Reading Images Presents the Launch of Socialist Architecture: The Vanishing Act The Socialist Federation of Yugoslavia dissolved in the early 1990s and new states were created. Each of these new regions inherited monuments, buildings, landscapes, and infrastructure, that were constructed for the Socialist Federation needs. After Yugoslavia disappeared, the majority of the inherited architecture was neglected, deteriorated, or repurposed. Join Storefront for Art and Architecture for their Reading Images series on October 16, 2012 at 7 pm, as they celebrate the launch of Socialist Architecture: The Vanishing Act, a collaborative book by photographer Armin Linke and architect Srdjan Jovanovic Weiss. The book documents the current fate of the inherited architecture in five particular countries: Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Serbia.	2

Chelsea – Having retained Drogba and Terry, The Blues should be fairly comfortable in terms of preparation here and retain pride in the fact that they’re the only one of the top four not to lose a key player. New signings were few and far between but regardless of whether Zhirkov is fit or not, a newly reborn Malouda will more than suffice. I fully expect Chelsea to win this one by at least two goals thus laying foundations for a serious title challenge. Plus points: Strong squad with quality and depth, Terry’s stay should boost fan morale. Doubts: Ancelotti’s willingness to learn from Scolari’s mistakes, Petr Cech’s form.	2

High Finance On the table was an agreement between the city and Eclipse Aerospace, the group that took over Eclipse Aviation when it went bankrupt. Eclipse Aerospace is offering to give the city 5.5 acres and a 40,000-square-foot building worth $3 million in exchange for about $5.8 million in rent credits. The building and land is just south of Double Eagle Airport on the city’s West Mesa. Eclipse would continue to use the building during the transition. To sweeten the deal, Eclipse Aerospace would prepay four years and four months of rent for their Sunport location as well. City administration and representatives from Eclipse Aerospace said this is a key piece of the financial puzzle that will keep the company in Albuquerque.	2

Designer offers a convenient installation like most modern software. A customized installation is possible. Nevertheless, although I carefully checked the items to be installed, thousands of bad cliparts for architecture and engineering which I wouldn't need in my whole life were copied to the hard disk which alone took two thirds of the installation time. It takes about 6 seconds to load Designer for the first time, including the generation of a new worksheet. Re-opening the program requires 2 seconds. Designer has smaller file sizes than Corel Draw. An empty sheet is only 4K large. A test drawing I made with a few circles and rectangles with different types of fillings and one text requires 6K as a DSF file. Surprisingly, sheets containing bitmap images are sometimes smaller than the original bitmaps, even if they were JPGs and therefore already compressed. Designer routinely creates a backup file with .BAK extension. Designer suffers a fatal crash when certain menu items are selected, namely Print - Files... and Send.... Ironically, send is missing in the help, so I will never figure out if and what it's supposed to mean. For Designer, the motto is definitely Save early, save often. Nevertheless, I didn't witness specific problems with system resources, unless Designer was running in parallel with one of the two competitors.	2

Ben Bernanke He has suggested setting an explicit inflation goal and de-emphasizing the traditional consumer-price index as the key indicator of inflation.

The lunar rover interface supports several driving modes. In the direct teleoperation mode, the human has full control over the rover. Almost all safeguarding is turned off. Direct teleoperation is necessary when the rover gets into situations where the software would otherwise prevent motion. For instance, there may be occasions where the pitch limits must temporarily be exceeded to drive the rover out of a crater. This mode is reserved for experienced drivers in exceptional situations.	2

M&A experts agree that “cultural misalignment” is a significant contributor to the poor performance of companies attempting M&A transactions. Traditional due diligence identifies the risk associated with target selection. However, there is another category of risk inherent with post-deal integration of operations that is overlooked by due diligence. Success with these deals depends on a clear understanding of the changes required by the business strategy and how those changes are likely to affect people – the key value drivers of the deal. Attempting an M&A transaction without an upfront integration risk assessment is like walking a tightrope without a net. It’s likely that there will be a fall with serious consequences.	2

County Question No. 3 (41 out of 41 Precincts Reporting) Shall Douglas County be authorized to levy an additional property tax rate for operation and maintenance of museums operated by the Douglas County Historical Society (the Historical Society) in an amount of 3/4 of 1 cent ($0.0075) per $100 assessed valuation for a period of up to 30 years? The cost for the owner of a new home with a fair market value of $100,000 is estimated to be $2.62 per year. If this portion of the property tax rate is approved by the voters, the amount is outside the caps on an individual's liability for property taxes established by the legislature in the 2005 Legislative Session.	2

- Single component equipment for most water activated hydrophobic PU foams, accelerator to be added prior to pumping. - Either single or two component equipment for true two component PU resins such as 1400 LV-Resin Line. - Either single component or multi-ratio two component equipment for hydrophilic PU Gels based on the application and product. In multi-ratio pumping one component carries a high water content. Single component pumps include inexpensive hand held devices, hand pumps and electric pumps. Multi ratio devices can be manual, electric and pneumatic. Some PU injection pumps can be used for epoxy injection (with limitations). SealBoss Corp. supplies PU as small as 1 gal units. We do not supply PU in cartridges for the following reasons: 1. Reduced shelf life in cartridge due to high moisture sensitivity, 2. Limited Injection pressure. For small jobs we recommend our (3000psi) handgun and a 1 gallon unit. Recommended Products: Hand held guns, manual pump HP100, electric pumps IP495 Pro, P2002	2

Robbing Peter to Pay Paul Councilors were asked to approve a change in the city’s Capital Improvement Plan by shifting $1.3 million in capital outlay money. The shift would move resources from Warehouse 508, the city’s Downtown teen center, to improvements to the BMX facility located near Isotopes Park, and to the Holiday Park Multigenerational Center in the Heights. Councilor Isaac Benton said the cash going to the BMX park would help fix a noise and dust mitigation design problem. Councilor Trudy Jones said the Holiday Park center is in need of safety improvements.	2

APD Aftermath Hours after all the public comment, councilors approved a request for a federal investigation into the police department. The idea of the feds snooping around did not sit well with the administration. City attorney Rob Perry jumped to his feet and addressed the Council in an attempt to derail a Department of Justice probe. Perry said the Council does not understand what is really going to happen by asking for federal intervention. He said APD brass is getting a grip on the problems, and he suggested tabling the action. The Council should get more information before taking such a drastic step, Perry added.	1

Army Career Tracker (ACT) Army Career Tracker (ACT) ACT, as a portal, links the Army's leadership development initiatives and lifelong learning as a continuum of service throughout one's career and beyond. Effective self-development and leader development require that individuals plan and capture their career goals and objectives within the Army training and leader development systems. Effective self-development and leader development require a system that allows the Soldiers and Army Civilians to: See: Give the ability for the individual to see their past accomplishments and their potential career development opportunities in a single easy to use interface. Understand: Provide context to the data being aggregated and provide recommendations to the individual on what courses of action to take to further develop their concerns. ACT: Once a course of action has been decided upon, give the ability to take action on this decision. Army Posture Statement for ACT Civilian Brochure Enlisted Brochure INCOPD Form 1-R-E ACT Authorization Request Form One Army School System (OASS) One Army School System (OASS) The One Army School System is one such initiative designed to enhance the Institutional Army's support of the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model. The current initiative at Fort Carson, Colo. will lead to a multi-component NCO Academy Table of Allowances and changes to WLC regionalization and distribution policies, which will accomplish the following: Streamline WLC student throughput. Gain training efficiencies in the planning and conduct of WLC throughout the Army. Achieve standardization of NCO Academy force structure throughout the Army. Upon full implementation, the One Army School System will provide increased training and education by leveraging the available resources of all three Army Components and establish multi-component facilities to train future warriors. Structured Self-Development (SSD) Structured Self-Development (SSD) Self Development is a key area and one of three domains of training and leader development. Structured Self Development (SSD) is planned; goal-oriented learning that reinforces and expands the depth and breadth of an individual's knowledge base, self awareness, and situational awareness. It complements institutional and operational learning, enhances professional competence, and meets personal objectives. The self development domain has three components: structured, guided and personal development. As an enabler to lifelong learning, SSD and Guided Self Development (GSD) bridge the gap between the institutional and operational domains in support of NCOES transformation. Enabling a train-ahead approach, the SSD consists of five levels of mandatory development spread across a Soldier's career. It will be supported by a robust evaluation and feedback process that includes self-assessment tools, the increased use of advanced technology like the Army Career Tracker, a secure test environment, achievable requirements, and policies that set the conditions for continuous growth. When fully implemented, SSD and GSD will improve Army readiness by integrating self-development into a lifelong learning approach. Lifelong learning is important to the entire Army, and for NCOs it is critical to foster an environment of continuous learning, since the challenges that face our NCOs are continuous. https://usasma.bliss.army.mil Army Learning Concept (ALC) 2015 Army Learning Concept (ALC) 2015 TRADOC is championing the Army Learning Concept for 2015. General Dempsey believes that in order to increase rigor, maintain relevancy, and prevail in the competitive learning environment, we have to change. Our current models have not kept pace with the rapid pace of change, the demands of Soldiers rotating in and out of the fight and a continuous influx of Soldiers with significant digital literacy. We all recognize the challenge and are working to adapt our learning models. We're changing our assumptions to look at the problem differently, because we know we can't afford to come up with the same solutions. Our solutions must consider emerging technologies and how Soldier's employ these technologies in their daily lives. TRADOC is reaching out to experts inside and outside the military to help in this effort. Army Learning Concept 2015 Noncommissioned Officers Education System (NCOES) Noncommissioned Officers Education System The NCOES provides noncommissioned officers (NCO) with progressive and sequential leader, technical, and tactical training relevant to the duties, responsibilities, and missions they will perform in operational units after graduation. The training and education process for the NCO starts with an initial, branchimmaterial, leadership development course; followed by a basic, branch-specific level; an advanced, branch-specific level; and culminates with a branch- immaterial senior level course. Army Posture Statement for NCOES NCOA MILCON NCOES Blackboard New Initiative New Initiative NCO 2020 : INCOPD conducted analysis Joint Force and Army 2020 documents to begin outlining potential changes in the skills and knowledge NCOs will need to execute Army missions. For example, the idea of regional alignment coupled with cultural awareness probably means that NCOs will need to have great depth of cultural knowledge as well as the ability to learn quickly about a specific culture. Based on that analysis, INCOPD is developing a NCO 2020 concept that will outline a revised approach to NCO development. Instructor Development and Recognition Program (IDRP): The IDRP enhances the professionalism of Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) instructors by selecting, training, and managing the best. In addition, the program provides added value to unit training when the instructor returns to the field. United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) have recognized the importance of supporting instructor development and establishing incentives for Soldiers who want to excel as instructors. The IDRP program provides award of Army Instructor Badges to NCOES instructors who obtain competencies and progress through Basic Instructor, Senior Instructor and Master Instructor levels of proficiency.

Bus Rider Blues Public transit issues concerning transfer fees, more bus stops and more bus stop shelters drew discussion. Four people, all representing services for the homeless or disabled, spoke about the hardship imposed on the most vulnerable citizens by 25 cent transfer fees and a lack of stops and routes. Councilor Michael Cadigan said it would be great if Westside Rapid Ride shelters were available. Chief Administrative Officer Ed Adams said the Northwest Rapid Ride Park and Ride was doing great and soon there would be a couple of shelters along Coors. Kathleen Cates, executive director of Susan’s Legacy (a transitional housing facility) protested the removal of bus stops that served clientele. An administration bill to add two new bus routes to the Westside passed unanimously.	1

The constructive doctrines which were elaborated in (John Locke's Second Treatise of Government) became the basis of social and political philosophy fo generations. (locke said) labor is the origin and justification of property; contract or consent is the ground of government and fixes its limits. Behind both doctrines lies the idea of the independence of the individual person. The state of nature knows no government. Men are subject to moral law. thus the government is instituted by a 'social contract'., its powers are limited, and they involve reciprocal obligations, moreover, they can be modified or rescinded by the authority which conferred them.	1

Once the grapes are picked and the whites are pressed, the grape skins are spread on the vineyard and turned into the soil in preparation of the winter.

PROBATION: The sentence given to a defendant when it is felt there is a good chance for rehabilitation without incarceration. In all felony cases, and at the judge's discretion in misdemeanor cases, a presentence report is used by the judge to decide whether or not to impose probation. Formal probation involves supervision of the defendant by a probation officer. Summary probation, Court probation or Conditional Revokable Release are all terms for probation without supervision, the defendant being responsible directly to the court. Common terms of probation include fines, jail, attendance at classes, and advance consent to being searched and tested.	1

Allows you to intercept overlay load operations by writing your own read routine. Documented a bit in the manual. Fairly handy, in that you could, for example, write a routine to load overlays that have been compressed, or that reside in XMS. Although it is documented which overlay is required (parameter OvrSeg is just the segment of the unit stub block, described in the text), where is goes and whether any fix-up exercise has to be done is totally undocumented (the answers are at ubsBufferSeg, and yes!). OvrInitEMS replaces the standard loader with its own.	1

Thought? Word? Deed? Councilor Michael Cadigan introduced a version of Kendra's Law proposed by Mayor Martin Chavez. The original Kendra's Law was named for Kendra Webdale, a young woman thrown under a New York subway train by a mentally ill man who had not been taking his medicine. Similar laws are called Assisted Outpatient Treatment (ACT) programs, but they allow a roommate, family member, city official or health care professional to petition the court for mandatory mental health treatment for persons who meet certain criteria. The criteria include mental illness, inability to survive safely in the community without supervision, a history of treatment noncompliance, hospitalization, incarceration and attempted violence.	1

Streetcar Ire Councilors were asked to approve a wish list to be sent to the Federal Transit Administration outlining which projects will be funded by more than $11 million from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The feds and city administration have already established the scope of what the stimulus money can be spent on: transit kiosks, fare boxes and related technologies, prefabricated shelters, and maintenance support vehicles for new and improved bus stops. Councilors threw in a couple of floor amendments, including one by Winter that removes any mention of a modern streetcar from the city’s overall Transportation Improvement Program.	1

Chapter II. The Origin of Christianity. -- Its Transformation on Attaining Imperial Power. -- Its Relations to Science. Religious condition of the Roman Republic. -- The adoption of imperialism leads to monotheism. -- Christianity spreads over the Roman Empire. -- The circumstances under which it attained imperial power make its union with Paganism a political necessity. -- Tertullian's description of its doctrines and practices. -- Debasing effect of the policy of Constantine on it. -- Its alliance with the civil power. -- Its incompatibility with science. -- Destruction of the Alexandrian Library and prohibition of philosophy. -- Exposition of the Augustinian philosophy and Patristic science generally. -- The Scriptures made the standard of science. In a political sense, Christianity is the bequest of the Roman Empire to the world. At the epoch of the transition of Rome from the republican to the imperial form of government, all the independent nationalities around the Mediterranean Sea had been brought under the control of that central power. The conquest that had befallen them in succession had been by no means a disaster. The perpetual wars they had maintained with each other came to an end; the miseries their conflicts had engendered were exchanged for universal peace. Not only as a token of the conquest she had made, but also as a gratification to her pride, the conquering republic brought the gods of the vanquished peoples to Rome. With disdainful toleration, she permitted the worship of them all. That paramount authority exercised by each divinity in his original seat disappeared at once in the crowd of gods and goddesses among whom he had been brought. Already, as we have seen, through geographical discoveries and philosophical criticism, faith in the religion of the old days had been profoundly shaken. It was, by this policy of Rome, brought to an end.	1

Money Dreams Late in the meeting, Councilors tackled what to do with the $3 million in funding originally set aside for Berry’s ABQ the Plan. Earlier this month, citizens voted down a bond issue that tied money for a multisport complex to cash for the Paseo del Norte interchange rebuild. One side of the Council wanted to save or put the money back into city operations, the other into Paseo.	1

WebSphere Message Broker, WebSphere MQ Integrator, and Integrator Broker product READMEs Where patches for a product are specified, this means that these patches were required to resolve problems found during testing and should therefore be considered as the minimum necessary maintenance level. Further maintenance should be applied in accordance with the guidance of the relevant software manufacturer. Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere Message Broker. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere Message Broker has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere Message Broker Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself.	1

Tooth preparationMany kinds of cosmetic dentistry involve tooth preparation, i.e. the permanent removal of some of your natural tooth structure. It is important that you understand that this is irreversible and because of this we will generally try to choose the cosmetic dentistry technique that will keep this tooth preparation to a minimum or as appropriate. For treatments such as Lumineers which promote ‘no preparation’ veneers you may find that to achieve the desired improvement some minimal modification to the dental tissues may be required. Often no local anaesthetic or temporary covering is needed. We will explain what is involved in your particular situation. Please note this consent form superceeds promotional information supplied by manufacturers of different types of veneers because we always work in the best interest of the patient. Porcelain Veneers and crowns are made from porcelain which is a brittle material and can fracture in function. This is a very rare in normal function but you should avoid abnormal use such as biting your finger nails or using your teeth to tear tape. Provisional crowns/veneers During your treatment provisional crowns or veneers maybe placed on your teeth. Unlike the permanent restorations these will usually be joined together and bonded lightly to your teeth. Each treatment has its own technique. You must be very diligent with your oral hygiene during this period and particularly careful about how you bite on your teeth. Avoid sticky foods. You may experience some sensitivity after the preparation of your teeth but this should not be excessive and usually resolves quickly. At no stage will you leave the practice without coverings to your dentine. Night guard appliance grinding (Risk & Prevention) Some people grind their teeth at night and this may put too much stress on any restoration. So following the cementation of your new teeth it may be necessary to fabricate an acrylic appliance or plastic bite guard which you may be prescribed to wear at night so as to relieve some of the load on the porcelain and to protect your new restorations and existing teeth. If you are prescribed this appliance it is important that you wear it otherwise your new restorations may fracture or debond.	1

On the long rides to concentration camps, many hundreds of people were crowded into boxcars. Because there was no room to sit, people had to stand for hours. There was no food, bathrooms or air. Often people died during the trip and others were unable to hold their bowel movements or urine. The smell of waste may easily trigger the memory of those train rides. Sanitary conditions in the camps were terrible. If a man or a woman wasn’t allowed to go to the barracks for toilet facilities, they may have had to soil themselves.	1

properties in BAIXO ALENTEJO The Baixo Alentejo is rural and unpopulated. As a result, farms are on vast estates (Herdades), with regional farmhouses. Some of these have been converted into places for rural tourism, as holiday homes on a self-catering basis or as charming country hotels offering bed and breakfast and outdoor activities. These Herdades have often been in the same family for generations. On the coast, accommodation is in charming renovated farm cottages near small villages between Odeceixe, Zambujeira do Mar and Vila Nova de Milfontes, ideal accommodation for those who enjoy the outdoors, with a stunning coastline at hand.	1

- Territorial definitions: what do they consider a part of their territory and how does that compare to their neighbors? Leads to disputes between neighboring countries. - the modern state is a geographical expression of the human tendency: the need to belong to a larger group that controls its own piece of the Earth, its own territory. - most geographers view territoriality as a learned cultural response. - Robert Sack regards territoriality as a cultural strategy that uses power to control an area and communicate that control, thereby subjugating the inhabitants and acquiring resources. - the marking of borders is a practice originally unique to modern Western culture. - political territoriality is cultural geographical phenomenon. - an important geographical aspect of the modern state is the shape and configuration of the national territory. - the more compact the territory, the easier is national governance. - circular or hexagonal forms maximize compactness, allow short communication lines and minimize the amount of border to be defended. - basic human characteristic to control a piece of earth • Instinctual- natural and unavoidable (tendency to want to control a piece of land) • Learned- cultural strategy to control people and resources	1

1. Test with the keyboard to verify keyboard equivalents for all actions. See the user interface style guidelines listed under Required development techniques for standard keys to be tested on each platform. At a minimum, the following keyboard operations must be tested: Navigate to and select all menus and menu items including the menu bar, system menu, and context menus Verify that each toolbar function can be performed using the keyboard. Navigate to and operate every control or hot spot in window client areas and dialog boxes. Navigate to sections or panes of the application window. Switch the keyboard focus between modeless dialogs and the application window. For elements accessible using the mouse (or touch), but not included in the navigation ring, verify that the same function is provided via a standard keystroke method. For example: Press F1 to access help, rather than selecting a help icon in the application. Verify that text and objects can be selected and copied into the system clipboard anywhere in the app where this is possible using the mouse or touch. Verify that features invoked via direct manipulation using the mouse or touch are available from the keyboard. For example, if an object can be sized using the mouse by drag and drop or gesture, it should also be able to be sized by setting the size attributes explicitly on a dialog or properties sheet. When scrollbars are present, verify that the area can be scrolled using standard keys to move the viewing area. When visual content exists beyond the viewing area and scroll bars are not shown, verify keystroke(s) can cause the beyond-view content to be displayed.	1

EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before income taxes plus net interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense. As indicated in the table, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the gain or loss on the disposal of assets, long-term incentive and equity compensation expenses, and transaction costs. Transaction costs are third party professional fees and other costs that are incurred in conjunction with closing a transaction. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, income before income taxes, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as those items are used to measure operating performance, liquidity, and our ability to service debt obligations. We believe that EBITDA provides additional information for evaluating our ability to make distributions to our common unitholders and is presented solely as a supplemental measure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information for evaluating our financial performance without regard to our financing methods, capital structure, and historical cost basis. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as we define them, may not be comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures used by other corporations or partnerships.	1

A Well-Regulated Fido and Fluffy Councilor Sally Mayer opened discussion of the 65-page plus HEART ordinance by calling on Chief Financial Officer Gail Reese to clarify erroneous information from an earlier meeting. At the May 1 meeting, Councilor Don Harris, who sponsored the administration's competing animal bill, had asked how much Mayer's bill would cost the city. Reese answered that the administration estimated Mayer's bill would cost an extra $5.6 million yearly. On May 22, Reese said the administration had previously estimated the bill's Safe Haven provision would triple costs for each animal at the city's shelters, since stays would be extended on average from four days to 12 days, but that information provided by Animal Services was in error. Mayer noted that adoptable animals were already staying 10.3 days on average. Reese said spay and neuter costs were covered by the budget bills just passed, and reiterated that she could not get reliable numbers from Animal Services.	1

Arbitration Ain't Arbitrary This labor-management dispute has gotten so muddled, it's hard to tell what it's even about anymore. It started with the Council approving a 3.5 percent wage increase for city workers. Instead, Mayor Martin Chavez opted to only give workers 3 percent, creating fallout for the Council and city employees. As a result, on Aug. 4, Councilors Debbie O'Malley and Rey Garduño introduced an ordinance that would allow an independent arbitrator to oversee labor-management negotiation impasses that last more than 15 days. Since city workers don't have the option to strike, arbitration is their only possible method of leverage. The bill passed 5-3 along party lines at the Council meeting on Aug. 18 but was directly vetoed by the mayor. At the Sept. 3 meeting, the option to override the mayor's veto was introduced.	1

Send All Your Money in a Brown Paper Bag Councilor Miguel Gomez sponsored a memorial urging the U.S. Congress to reject any proposals to privatize Social Security accounts or to cut benefits. One high school student said that if Americans have to put their Social Security money into corporate stocks, there would be no incentive to hold corporations accountable. An AARP representative warned about indexing benefits to prices instead of wages. Carter Bundy said the transitional costs of $2 trillion to $5 trillion would be bad for business and for New Mexico.	1

Red-Light Sparks Fly Sparks flew between Councilor Michael Cadigan and two of the mayor’s right-hand men, Ed Adams and Pete Dinelli, during the informal question-and-answer portion of the meeting. Cadigan threw his first jab by asking Adams if there was a signed five-year extension to the city's contract with Redflex Traffic Systems. After more pressure from Cadigan, Adams answered that there was a signed contract on his desk, but the administration was waiting to see whether the Legislature would continue to squeeze the program's cash flow. Cadigan demanded Adams go get the signed, but not tendered, contract off his desk. Adams refused. Cadigan accused Adams of withholding public documents from the Council. But this was not the end of the verbal sparring—the city's Chief Public Safety Officer Dinelli told Cadigan the councilor would be asked to abstain from any future voting on Redflex issues. Cadigan responded by calling Dinelli the mayor's attack dog.	1

Bundy said the ad completely misrepresented the minimum wage ballot initiative by saying it would allow the general public to enter a workplace and open records to the public.	1

Please Tell Me You’re Making That Up During public comment, dozens of people stood in support of Albuquerque transit workers. Kip Bobroff of Albuquerque Interfaith said 267 bus drivers were being treated irresponsibly and unjustly. Drivers’ complaints included being terminated for engaging in union activity, receiving lower pay than solid waste drivers and unsafe conditions on night routes. The protesting workers, now represented by the New Mexico Transportation Union (NMTU), want to vote on being represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Ronald Medina, president of the Blue Collar Union, said four employees had been run over by trucks at the landfill. Medina said kennel personnel at the animal shelters didn’t have safe cages to transport animals or enough disinfectants for cleaning, and were beheading cats and dogs with rusty machetes.	1

Notes: 1. Rates/equations used to calculate the above thresholds are from Trip Generation Manual, 7th Edition, 2003, by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. This table will likely need updating as future editions provide additional information. 2. For example, a full traffic impact study should be completed (100 peak hour, peak direction trips generated) if 150 or more single family units are proposed for a site. 3. GLA – Gross Leasable Area; GFA – Gross Floor Area. 4. Using AM peak-hour rates/equations would provide a lower threshold. However, adjacent roadway volumes are usually higher during the PM peak hour. 5. Uses both “Service Station with Market” and “Convenience Market with Pumps” data. 6. For further trip generation characteristics of the above land uses, or of other uses not illustrated above, refer to the latest version of Trip Generation.	1

Nucleic acid quantification utilizes theory of limiting sample dilution that is spread across many technical replicate PCR reactions. Absolute quantification is determined by ratio of number of negative versus total reactions. This type of analysis is different from Ct and delta Ct comparisons, and instead allows each assayed target to be quantified independently without the need for reference standards.	1

It is important to use low-binding plastics as much as possible throughout experimental set-up. Since digital PCR emphasizes assaying limiting dilution, any sample that sticks to intermediate set-up equipment will be lost and skew results. We recommend using low binding 2.0 mL tubes for dilutions and low-retention pipette tips. It is important to know the digital area of the desired sample to be tested. If unknown, consult user guide for help in determining copy number of known species (gDNA) or perform a preliminary screening experiment with multiple dilutions of sample/assay combination to determine optimal digital concentration to ensure meaningful data attained. Sample should not be kept at low concentration for extended periods of time, nor exposed to excessive freeze-thawing. Carriers have not been shown to be as important to reproducibility as much as using non-stick plastics for experimental set-up. Careful planning of dilutions is desired to minimize variability due to dilution scheme.	1

BMX Track: Move It or Lose It Benton asked the Council to go along with a 30-day moratorium on any city-funded building at the BMX arena near Isotopes Park. A floor amendment was added directing city staff to look into moving the dirt track back to the west end of the site where it was originally approved. Instead, the track was built in the east, causing neighbors to protest the dust and noise from the arena. The city administration has said the track would not fit on the west end, so it was moved. Neighbors filed a lawsuit in 2007 over the issue. It was settled in April.	1

After looking into the two types of fluids used in Houdini, Voxel and Particle Based, I decided to focus on the latter. This method is more appropriate to create liquids and viscous fluids mainly due to the lack of spatial limitation and that was the focus of my research. In this presentation I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of particle based fluids, when compared to voxel fluids, and explain what are the best techniques and practices to achieve good visual results that can be integrated in cartoon or realistic shots. At the end of the presentation I will screen some scenes created while researching this topic. These videos will demonstrate the effect and function of different parameters, the integration of this technique with others such as Rigid Body Dynamics and finally some examples of possible usage of particle based fluids in production of visual effects.

The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system, or HACCP, focuses on preventing problems that could lead to foodborne illness or injury. HACCP is a management system that is required for meat and poultry products amenable to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection plus seafood and juice products amenable to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection. This lesson provides an overview of the HACCP concept and the advantage of using HACCP over traditional testing methods to control food hazards. It also provides an overview of the origin of the HACCP system, the seven HACCP principles used to develop an effective plan to prevent, eliminate, or reduce food hazards to acceptable levels, and the basic application guidelines necessary for implementing a HACCP plan.	1

Chapter IV. The Restoration of Science in the South. By the influence of the Nestorians and Jews, the Arabians are turned to the cultivation of Science. -- They modify their views as to the destiny of man, and obtain true conceptions respecting the structure of the world. -- They ascertain the size of the earth, and determine its shape. -- Their khalifs collect great libraries, patronize every department of science and literature, establish astronomical observatories. -- They develop the mathematical sciences, invent algebra, and improve geometry and trigonometry. -- They collect and translate the old Greek mathematical and astronomical works, and adopt the inductive method of Aristotle. -- They establish many colleges, and, with the aid of the Nestorians, organize a public-school system. -- They introduce the Arabic numerals and arithmetic, and catalogue and give names to the stars. -- They lay the foundation of modern astronomy, chemistry, and physics, and introduce great improvements in agriculture and manufactures. In the course of my long life, said the Khalif Ali, I have often observed that men are more like the times they live in than they are like their fathers. This profoundly philosophical remark of the son-in-law of Mohammed is strictly true; for, though the personal, the bodily lineaments of a man may indicate his parentage, the constitution of his mind, and therefore the direction of his thoughts, is determined by the environment in which he lives.	1

Where the Rubber Meets the Road Ten years ago voters approved a quarter-cent gross receipts transportation tax. If city residents want to continue funding road and transportation projects, it is time to tax again. City administration proposed varying percentages that would split tax money between five transit areas: road rehabilitation, road deficiencies, road maintenance, trails and bikeways, and public transit, which gets the biggest piece of consumer tax money. There is still about $52 million unspent in the road tax fund from prior years. Michael Riordan, spokesperson for the city’s administration, said the excess came from an unexpected increase in consumer spending a few years ago. That money is in the process of being appropriated. An amendment would have increased the public transit and road rehabilitation percentage, decreased the road deficiencies amount, and left the road maintenance and bike/trails portions unchanged. The tax works out to be 25 cents for every $100 spent in Albuquerque, drawing into city coffers about $37 million annually.	1

Switches the Excel 'iteration' facility on so that circular references can be used (equivalent to 'Tools/Options/Calculation/Iteration'). Also allows you to specify the number of iterations performed in one go. To the ImagineIT buttons you need a cell on your worksheet named 'Counts'. Each time the worksheet is recalculated, Counts increments by one, (or by whatever you have set the number of iterations to be). Counts is reset to one by the 'Reset iteration' button. If you also have a cell called Counter (to the right of Counts or below it) this will be reset to zero by 'Reset iteration', so you can start counting at zero rather than one.	1

IOM Albania’s main goals are to: Support the full implementation of the country's policy on migration. Seek ways of assisting Albanian migrants whenever possible. The Organization cooperates with international and local partners and the government of Albania to identify timely and cost-effective ways of meeting migratory challenges in line with the country's EU integration priorities.	1
Robert Sandeman (1718-1771), was a student at the University of Edinburgh where he met John Glas (1695-1773). John Glas believed in the restoration of the New Testament church and he began in repudiating human creeds, human names and human doctrines. Robert not only had a brilliant mind but an outgoing personality. About 1755 he joined John Glas and together they set out to restore primitive New Testament practices. Both believed in church autonomy, observing the Lord's Supper on the first day of the week, that faith comes as a result of evidence or testimony, and the possibility of restoring the New Testament church. Robert Sandeman came to America in 1763 where he established the Lord's church in Boston, Massachusetts, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Danbury, Connecticut. He settled in Danbury and remained there until he died on April 2, 1771 at the age of 53 years.	1

AHS refers to a dedicated highway lane in which vehicles are automatically controlled -- the vehicles' steering, braking and throttle are controlled by the system, not the driver. The AHS lanes and the vehicles that operate on them will have special sensors, computers and communications devices to enable automated control. The 1997 Proof-of-Technical-Feasibility Demonstration to be conducted by the National Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC) responds to a provision in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991.	1

Sample WP108 had a 9,10-anthracenedione soil concentration of 1.6J mg/kg (J=estimatedquantity). A screening value for this compound is not available. 9,10-Anthracenedione isin a class of semivolatile organic compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs). Although a screening value is not available for this compound, ATSDR assumedits toxicity to be as great as the most toxic PAH, benzo[a]pyrene with a screening value of0.78 mg/kg. Because the screening value is based on 30 years of exposure, 250 days/yearand the sample location is in a fenced area restricting public access, this soil sample withthis concentration does not present an apparent public health hazard.	1

Some representatives indicated that efficient aid delivery involved action on many fronts, several of which were particularly important: (a) as much aid as possible should be available on a predictable basis; (b) specific conditions and challenges of delivering aid to fragile States deserved special consideration; (c) there was a need to ensure that aid was better distributed so as to avoid “donor darlings” and “donor orphans”; (d) the issue of aid effectiveness in the United Nations system should be addressed to make the United Nations development assistance channels more attractive to donors; (e) the progress that had been made on innovative sources of finance should be built on; and (f) there was a need to ensure that development aid would lead to “climate proof” aid programmes to prevent environmental degradation	1

Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server locking is fully automatic and does not require intervention by users. Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server applies exclusive locks for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. When an exclusive lock is set, no other transaction can obtain any type of lock on those objects until the original lock is in place. For non-update or read operations, a shared lock is applied. If a shared lock is applied to a table or a page, other transactions can also obtain a shared lock on that table or page. However, no transaction can obtain an exclusive lock. Therefore, Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server reads block the modifications to the data. Update locks: Update locks are held at the page level. They are placed during the initial stages of an update operation when the pages are being read. Update locks can co-exist with shared locks. If the pages are changed later, the update locks are escalated to exclusive locks.	1

If a signal is not connected to an inlet of tapout~, a fixed delay algorithm is used, and a float or int received in the inlet sets the delay time of the signal coming out of the corresponding outlet. This may cause clicks to appear in the output when the delay time is changed. However, fixed delay is suitable for many applications such as reverberation where delay times do not change dynamically, and it is computationally less expensive than the continuous delay algorithm.	1

Flash Point In meeting after meeting for the last several months, people have lined up and asked—even tearfully begged—the Council to rein in an out-of-control police department. The resolution to override the Mayor’s veto brought even more people and heated rhetoric to the Council’s chambers. The override failed after a gruff debate, and many attendees reacted in outrage. Tension between the administration and councilors in support of a federal probe is growing: Garduño had to raise his voice to hold the floor and speak over Chief Administrative Officer Rob Perry’s interruptions.	1

marine motors. He initiated several projects concerning this industry in addition to his regular duties. In devising a chart for the location of mines and underwater obstacles, he obtained and disseminated information to prevent loss of life and property. He went through mine-laden waters in small craft with the fishermen making continuous surveys. He displayed great resourcefulness in salvaging empty tin cans from military dumps to replace shortage of tin plate required for canning and in salvaging grass rope and other commodities required to return the fishing industry to normal production. He was instrumental in the publication of a civil affairs manual issued by the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, which was later used as a model for all European countries and as a guide for military government officers in the Southwest Pacific Area. He was commended by Italian officials for his contribution to the restoration of normal living, food implementation and the rehabilitation of one of the most important industries in Italy.	1

Name comes from Río Oja, a tributary of the Ebro. There were vineyards there in Roman times. Mordern history began when a lot of Bordeaux merchants, winemakers, grapegrowes moved here because of the the destruction of their vineyards by phylloxera. That's why the trade was based, until recently, around merchants and their brand names, rather than around vineyards and their growers. More recently the liberation of Spain from the Franco era led to renaissance of the trade, with a number of new companies being established. This led to a move away fom wines that aged long in casks to wines longer aged in bottles	1

Has the introduction of the practice screen and other introductory screens helped reduce the cognitive load experienced by students? Has the introduction of the Case Study helped reinforce the relevance of this material to the curriculum. 2. Learning Process Issues Given that the context of learning has changed so significantly, are there any noticeable differences in the way students now use this resource?	1

Coziness Threatened, Coziness Restored Councilor Brad Winter moved a revised version of the ethics bill he's been working on for months. The bill covers selection and training of Ethics Board members; gives the board subpoena power; spells out disqualifying conflicts of interest for city officials; defines improper use of city resources or employees; regulates campaign practices, gifts and travel; and sets rules for awarding city contracts. Winter said the bill took so long because he had gotten input from everyone, including agreement on amendments by the Council and administration. Several speakers praised the bill. Andres Valdes of Vecinos United said, Boy, we sure need it. Rev. Daniel Erdman of Albuquerque Interfaith said, The love of unaccountable power is the root of all evil. Before awarding some city contracts, a committee evaluates proposals, ranks the top three firms and submits those names to the mayor, who usually chooses the firm with the highest point total. Rarely, the second- or third-ranked firm is chosen. Much debate concerned whether a councilor could vote to approve a second- or third-ranked firm that had contributed to that councilor's campaign.	1

A Nonmeeting of Montaño Minds The controversial Montaño Bridge was built with the agreement that it would remain two-lane until problems were remedied at the Fourth Street and Second Street intersections. Problems still exist but Mayor Martin Chavez ordered parts of the road re-striped to four lanes without consulting O'Malley, the district's councilor. After her earlier bill requiring an independent transportation study was vetoed by Chavez, O'Malley moved a compromise bill worked out with the administration.	1

Fake Plastic Trees An appeal about a cell phone tower called for the Council to clarify what counts as aesthetic concealment. David Campbell, representing T-Mobile West, said cell phone towers are being turned down by the Planning Department, which is requiring near invisibility. “These are not decorations,” he said. “These are infrastructure, like power lines.” More than 140 people in the Northeast Heights neighborhood near Louisiana and Montgomery destined to be the site of the cell phone tower signed a petition against it. A neighborhood representative showed that there will be nothing to block the tower on the east and south. The city says there's another site available on the lot that would have more screening.	1

The determination of Bioavailability is determined by comparing the AUC (IV) to the AUC (other route of administration). IV is determined to be the “gold standard’ thus all other modes of ingestion fractions of that percentage. Bioavailability can be affected by enzymatic destruction, remaining soluble enough to pass throughout the body, but also having enough lipophilicity or specificity to cross plasma membranes. Drugs with low oral bioavailability due to being affected by first pass factors are not suitable oral drugs and alternate forms of administration must be utilized(Other forms of administration include: Intramuscular, Subcutaneous, Inhalation, Transdermal, Oral, and Topical)	1

An endothelial injury leads to LDL infiltration into the vessel wall. The LDL is modified/oxidized leading to uptake and accumulation within Macrophages (foam cells). Once activated, the macrophages release inflammatory cytokines leading to activated T cells, monocyte recruitment and intimal migration of smooth muscle cells (atheroma formation). With accumulation in the tunica intima, there is progressive weakening of the tunica media.	1

For software requirements, the Program Directory shipped with the product contains the latest level of information, particularly concerning APAR or PTF levels of supported products. z/OS includes appropriate levels of Language Environment, TCP/IP, VTAM, SMP/E, TSO/E, JES, C/C++, DFSMS / DFP, Security Server, High Level Assembler, ISPF, and ICSS. The product versions listed here represent the minimum level of that product that is supported, unless otherwise stated. For installation, the only requirement is the level of operating system listed below, which will include the pre-requisite level of SMP/E. Defect support is available for virtualization environments where they relate to releases of this platform already supported by WebSphere MQ. Unless stated elsewhere in the system requirements, WebSphere MQ has not been specifically tested in virtualization environments. WebSphere MQ Support is therefore unable to assist in issues related to configuration and setup, or issues that are directly related to the virtualization environment itself.	1

Floating Money There is $3 million without a destination after voters rejected the mayor’s ABQ the Plan bond proposal. Voters said “no” to a measure that tied $25 million for reconstructing the Paseo del Norte and I-25 interchange to $25 million for a sports complex.

Material: In order to help you select the best vibrator to suit your needs, Edenfantasys offers our material filter categories and the Sex toy material guide on each type we offer. Strong vibrations are best carried through toys made from firm materials such as Plastic, Acrylic, or Metal. Realistic feeling vibrators, made from Skin like materials, mimic the feel of flesh with soft surfaces and a velvety texture. For mild stimulation, choose soft materials like Jelly or Elastomer. For a mix of soft and firm, Silicone is a great option. These vibrators are flexible, durable, and carry vibrations well.	1

Background: Under direction of the TRADOC Commanding General, the Institute for NCO Professional Development (INCOPD) began operations on the 7th of August 2009 with initial operating capability on 8th of September 2009. The primary reason for the formation was to bring a fragmented NCO professional development program under a single effort. The INCOPD provides a means of integrating all of the activities associated with NCO development and reports directly to the Commander of TRADOC. Organization, Mission and Responsibilities: INCOPD's mission: To provide direction and oversight to the NCOES across the Army; to integrate all actions and activities related to NCO Leader development into the Army Leader Development Strategy, and to serve as the NCO subject matter experts for the Army Leader Development Community.

Read more (2) Lead agent for the NCO Development Program. As a TRADOC special activity agency, serves as the lead agent for the development and management of the NCO Development Program within the Army. In addition INCOPD supports the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center (CAC) in the execution of leader development requirements. The purpose of INCOPD is to give NCOs responsibility and accountability to NCOs for NCOES and put NCOs in charge of their leader development. (3) Integrate all actions and activities related to NCO leader development into the overall Army Leader Development Strategy. INCOPD also serves as lead for all NCO cohort initiatives. It also serves as an integrating element for all directed NCO leader development requirements for HQDA, TRADOC and CAC. (4) Organization: INCOPD consists of four divisions (Operation and Strategies; Learning Integration; Learning Execution and Evaluation; and Learning Innovations and Initiatives) and the US Army Sergeants Major Academy (USASMA).	1

Juan’s Target experience started with leading the electronics department at our store in Delray Beach, Fla. Twelve years later, he’s leading one of our key operations teams for stores nationwide. “I’ve found that throughout my career, Target has made me a leader and not just a supervisor or a boss,” Juan says. “We all have things that we are naturally good at and we all have things that we may never be great at, and Target looks for your strengths and gives you the tools to continue to leverage those strengths.”	1

The Unclear Act A bill currently in Congress shoves part of the burden of enforcing immigration laws onto state and local police departments and threatens to cut some funding for localities that don't knuckle under. The Federal Department of Sanctimonious Naming has titled this abomination the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, or the CLEAR Act. (Maybe they'll name Bush's belief that he can authorize torture the Ominibus Unilateral Cruel and Hellacious Interrogation of Evildoers Act, or the OUCHIE Act.) Griego sponsored a resolution opposing any legislation that would use Albuquerque police to enforce federal immigration policies or use municipal resources to apprehend people solely on immigration reasons.	1

No. You Can't Do That. Councilor Brad Winter said he appreciated all the cooperation during a year of working on his ethics bill. He said his work on the governor's ethics task force showed that issues were the same at the state level. The bill bars councilors from voting on matters involving most campaign contributors. Saying councilors didn't keep handy contribution lists, Cadigan verified that staff would notify councilors if an upcoming bill affected any of their contributors.	1

To Notify or Not to Notify The Southwest Alliance of Neighbors (SWAN) appealed an Environmental Planning Commission decision to approve a zoning amendment for a 40-acre mobile home park just west of Coors on Ervien. SWAN disagrees that more mobile homes are a good thing for an area already burdened with low-income housing. But the group could not register an opinion due some glitch at the Office of Neighborhood Coordination. SWAN appealed, saying it did not receive notice of the planning hearings. The city staff said SWAN was not entitled to notice because it is an alliance or coalition of neighborhood associations, not an individual association. Office of Neighborhood Coordination Manager Patrick Montoya said SWAN does not have notification paperwork on file. Just about then, SWAN President Klarissa Pena, along with a handful of other members, presented their copy of an April 2008 registration, signed by Montoya.	1

This also includes consideration of the greenwashing’s audience and the assumptions and implications that that greenwashing makes in relationship with that audience.

Just Because I Say So Last year the City Council voted to issue a contract to Albuquerque Partnership, a nonprofit social-service provider that coordinates efforts against substance abuse in several underserved neighborhoods. The mayor cut the funding; the Council reinstated it. The mayor changed the scope of the contract but kept the same funding, $188,000. The Partnership wouldn't go for the new contract and has brought a lawsuit against the administration, with the Council named as an involuntary plaintiff. Members of the Partnership have showed up regularly at Council meetings saying they haven't received the money allocated in the contract they signed. Councilors Debbie O'Malley and Brad Winter sponsored a bill requiring the mayor to release the funds and specifying that the Mayor's Office not spend taxpayer funds to fight the lawsuit. Chief Administrative Officer Jay Czar said the mayor planned to veto the bill.	1

Funds from operations (FFO) is defined as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles - GAAP) excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate. The Company considers FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flows as a measure of the Company's activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.	1

The Gates of Gondor Recently, Councilor O'Malley questioned the cost increase from $370,000 to $840,000 for the 65-foot tall Tricentennial Towers to be erected at I-40 and Rio Grande, as well as their funding source [See Newscity, The Two Towers, Nov. 10-16 click here]. O'Malley said the administration had taken care of the previously inappropriate funding and it was now appropriate. She said the director of the New Mexico Department of Transportation had called that afternoon and said the DOT would work with the city on the landscaping project.	1

This is the most common archetype in western organizations. It brings the energy of working hard to make the world a better place. The Warrior translates into vitality, competition, discipline, focus and determination. There is a fair amount of self-sacrifice in the Warrior for the betterment of the larger whole. Warrior organizations usually have a cause and are able to enlist employees in working for it. These organizations value the actions of the Warrior and recognize them with a number of rewards. Organisations with strong warrior energy are ready to exert themselves completely for an important aim. They are purposeful, persevering, and well prepare for her challenges. They control her tools and act. As shadow forms they are hard, crude, fights without taking into consideration (human) losses.	1

The report on the Organization's work program on the improvement of agricultural statistics was approved by the Council which commended the DirectorGeneral on the results achieved. The method of random sampling provided a rapid and economical means of improving agricultural statistics, particularly in those areas where statistics are incomplete in coverage and, to a large measure, unreliable. The measures taken for the dissemination of the information bearing on the use of sampling should prove useful; the Council approved in particular the preparation of the two manuals, one on the methods used for the collection of current agricultural statistics in different countries, and the other on the theory of sampling surveys and its applications to agriculture. The first would also serve to give a critical appraisal of the available statistics published by different countries and the second to help introducing the improved systems of collecting statistics based on sampling. The Council cautioned against haste inasmuch as the random sampling method had its limitations and might not be suitable under all conditions, and in some instances not be as efficient as a complete census or other sampling methods. It also observed that in writing the manual on sampling no attempt should be made to recommend exclusively any specific methods. The organization of sampling demonstration centers to illustrate the rôle and possibilities of this method in improving existing systems of collecting statistics was approved and the Director-General was invited to continue action on these lines, leaving it to the countries concerned to develop the most appropriate methods under their own conditions. The progress made in the application of sampling and the lines of work in this field should be periodically reviewed.	1

Extreme Makeover Three administration bills annexing 69 acres in Miguel Gomez's District 1 came to a vote after much negotiation between developers and neighborhood residents. Residents expressed concern about the high densities proposed with schools already overcrowded. Councilor Debbie O'Malley said, We keep hearing that people aren't going to want to build in the city because of the Planned Growth Strategy. If the PGS was so bad, she asked Jim Strozier of Consensus Planning, why did his client, Albuquerque Excavators, want the city to annex the land for its proposed development?	1

EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS - The property manager demonstrates efficiency when he or she discovers ways of performing basic management tasks at reduced costs. The efficient property manager understands both the maintenance and repair requirements of the building and cost-effective purchasing procedures for the materials and services required. He or she is proficient at collecting rents and knows the laws concerning the enforcement of lease provisions. The effective manager knows what parts of the building exhibit physical deterioration and functional obsolescence and how to cure the physical deterioration and correct the functional obsolescence. He or she also knows where to get the lowest prices for high quality appliances, equipment, materials, and supplies. The property manager is effective when he or she is an innovator. Effective property management requires the manager to investigate opportunities to generate additional revenue by expanding the market that the property can serve. The effective property manager not only works to solve problems and to do things more efficiently through lower costs but also attempts to understand what creates problems. For example, an efficient property manager who recognizes high vacancy levels in the recent past will work diligently to get desirable vacant space ready for the market as cheaply and as quickly as possible. The effective property manager will do the same thing but will move one step beyond by asking the question, Why has the property faced high vacancies? An efficient property manager is reactive. He or she responds to problems and handles those problems in the appropriate manner while attempting to control the cost. The effective property manager is an active agent or force in making things happen. The effective property manager identifies the problem, solves it, and then analyzes the situation to learn the cause of the problem.	1

Grand Scale Mayor Martin Chavez, councilors and local business leaders are bubbling with enthusiasm for a proposed development at Broadway and Central—an 11,000-seat event center and arena. The event center would be located in the east end of the project, which is bounded by the intersection of the First Baptist Church, Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Second Street and Central. The project would include a 450-room hotel near the Convention Center, with retail shops between the two. The project is estimated to cost between $350 and $400 million. Councilor Isaac Benton, whose district includes the site, moved the administration bill authorizing a $700,000 contract for a viability assessment. The contract is with ABQ Downtown Development Team, a consortium of local and out-of-state businesses that would build the arena project. Business leaders who spoke supporting the arena include Hyatt Regency General Manager Karl Holme, Downtown Action Team Executive Director Brian Morris, Convention Center Manager Dale Lockett and Larry Smith, speaking for the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties. State Sen. Shannon Robinson proposed the state fairgrounds as an alternate location.	1

Over more than a century, Palestinian cultural heritage has been managed by several different administrations. Each of these has had its own methods of management, protection, research, and distinct political purpose, making Palestinian cultural heritage one of the most intensively abused, excavated and subsequently disturbed worldwide. In accordance with the Oslo Accords (1993-1995), the Palestinian Authority took over responsibility for archaeology in Areas “A” and “B”, representing about 40% of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In spite of this inequity, it was the first time that the Palestinian people were given an opportunity to manage their own heritage. This paper attempts to discuss these issues and their negative impact on archaeological sites in the Hebron district. Special attention will be given to the state of cultural heritage since the Oslo Accords, when Palestinian cultural heritage started being operated by two contested administrations: the Palestinian Department of Antiquities in areas “A and B”, and the Israeli Staff Officer for Archaeology in area “C”. Clandestine excavations, illicit trafficking and the state of conservation of Palestinian cultural heritage are also explored to demonstrate the protection, conservation and development dynamics of archaeological sites in this area and how this dually contested management tremendously affects safeguarding of the heritage in the Hebron area. Illegal Israeli excavations, so-called “salvage excavations”, and the devastating impact of the separation wall on archaeological sites and the cultural landscape are also briefly discussed.	1

Organic, spring center replacement disc designed for smooth engagement, quiet operation and improved durability. We offer the best brands and type for the application. Some OE Street Clutch discs can be used with moderate to heavy duty applications including racing depending on torque output and heat. When a Performance OrganicOE disc is available the suffix S will appear in the disc part number. These discs use special performance linings that are designed to withstand high heat and high RPM. When the suffix M appears, the disc has been modified by reducing the marcel enabling quicker action. With all the hype about different lining materials available we still contend that nothing can beat a good quality full face organic disc for street use. This same clutch performance lining is available for several applications where there is a particular need.These clutch discs take a lot of abuse and yet engage smoothly.	1
