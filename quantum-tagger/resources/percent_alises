Max LTV Sort upwards Sort downwards Help Max LTV This is the maximum LTV that will be accepted for this product. The loan to value represents the percentage of the value of the property which the borrower is seeking to borrow. E.g. a £100K property with an £80K mortgage = an 80% LTV. The maximum LTV we will lend will depend on your individual situation, the property, the loan you choose and the amount you borrow.	6

PPG: 9.7 RPG: 4.7 FT%: 58.3 Sophomore Quincy Pondexter has quietly been averaging nearly 10 points per game this season. He started 22 of 32 games as a redshirt freshman in 2006-07 and averaged 10.7 points and four rebounds per game. At 6-foot-6 and 210 pounds, Pondexter is a forward that can get dirty in the post or step out and hit the long range shot. He shot 37.5 percent last season from behind the arc. He's hit two of five this season.	3

* Based on evaluable patients with confirmed duodenal ulcer (active or within one year) and H. pylori infection at baseline defined as at least two of three positive endoscopic tests from CLOtest (Delta West LTD., Bentley, Australia), histology, and/or culture. Patients were included in the analysis if they completed the study. Additionally, if patients were dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug, they were included in the analysis as evaluable failures of therapy. # Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline as defined above and had a confirmed duodenal ulcer (active or within one year). All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. † (p < 0.05) versus BIAXIN/lansoprazole and lansoprazole/amoxicillin dual therapy. ‡ (p < 0.05) versus BIAXIN/amoxicillin dual therapy. ¶ The 95% confidence interval for the difference in eradication rates, 10-day minus 14-day, is (-10.5, 8.1) in the evaluable analysis and (-9.7, 9.1) in the intent-to-treat analysis.	3

Bread made with whole grains usually contains a mix of refined flour and whole grain flour. It has a lighter texture and taste than whole wheat, making it a good choice for people who are transitioning from white bread to 100% whole-wheat bread. While it's lower in fiber, it is usually enriched with vitamins and minerals.	3

PPG: 23.0 RPG: 11.7 FT%: 68.4 Junior forward Jon Brockman may be undersized in the middle when it comes to height, but his physical play combined with sound fundamentals has allowed him to have a fantastic start to the 2007-08 season averaging a double-double through the first three games. Brockman will have a tough time against the trees of A&M, but he can also use his body well enough to negate A&M's height advantage. The Aggies will go at him on the offensive end to try to get him into foul trouble as the Huskies will go as far as Brockman will take them.	3

As well as Designer performs as a stand-alone application, as horribly bad is the interface to other programs and formats. Virtually none of the vector import and export filters works properly, most of them refuse the conversion at all. Designer 8 imports all older Designer versions, only the grid is sometimes not reconstructed. Anyway, it is possible to restore it by choosing the very same settings as in the imported file - but these must be obtained by loading them in an old Designer version. Designer imports Corel drawings up to version 8, but only simple formats, at most a normal gradient filling is preserved. The worst thing is that all the colors are forced into the current Designer palette and look accordingly ugly afterwards. To import an Illustrator file I had to go down to Illustrator version 6.0, and like in the imported CDR file the colors were completely messed up. Since Illustrator uses a grid based on the obscure point unit I didn't even try to retain it. Import of WMF/EMF seems to work in most cases, but export only on an arbitrary basis. Sometimes only one object was actually exported, even if the whole drawing was selected (it shouldn't depend on the selection anyway). One thing I hate about the WMF and EMF formats is that Windows locks them once they are loaded in another program, and it is not possible to overwrite them from the original program, unless both programs are closed. EPS and PDF import don't work at all, although they are allegedly supported. HPGL import requires renaming the file to PLT, otherwise the program doesn't recognize it as convertible. Nevertheless, the conversion didn't work at all, and nothing but a text line was imported. It is surprising but true that an empty drawing with an embedded bitmap may be smaller than the original bitmap. I tested this with a medium-sized LZW-compressed TIF and a moderately compressed JPG file. In both cases the DSF file was smaller, without losing resolution or color depth. The proof: I loaded the original file in Micrografx Image, imported the embedded bitmap via the clipboard, and calculated the difference. The image was plain black and the histogram showed 100% black too. It's good to see that bitmap images don't get lost when they are in a vector drawing, and that the original can be recovered any time. Nonetheless, bitmap export with Designer is a disaster, no matter which format is selected. The dedicated export filter (that writes a new bitmap file) creates ugly bitmaps in which different portions are often either too much smoothed or too rough. Disabling the smoothing (anti-aliasing) doesn't work at all. The second option, the import filter for DSF in the sister program iGrafx Image (intended for bitmap graphics) performs even worse and creates images with ridiculously small resolution and stepped color gradients. The third option, using the clipboard, is not available any longer, since the drawing is not copied in its current screen size (which I always liked as a reliable preview), but in the paper resolution, and converted to a bitmap with exactly this resolution as late as it is inserted into another program. Fortunately there is a fourth option to convert the drawing to a bitmap which remains embedded in Designer and copy this bitmap to the clipboard. It remains a mystery why the image is scaled down again to a useless size when pasted into iGrafx Image and Corel Photopaint, irrespective of the ppi resolution chosen in Designer, on one computer, whereas it works properly on another one.	2

PPG: 5.0 RPG: 5.5 FG%: 50 Senior center Victor Ramalho is one of three returning starters for the Miners and averaged four points and 3.7 rebounds per game last season. The 6-foot-9, 255-pounf Brazilian native is a big body that won't allow the Aggies to push him around in the post. Ramalho isn't known for his scorer, but rather his work on the boards and his defensive capabilities around the rim.	2

PPG: 20.0 RPG: 6.0 FG%: 90.0 Senior center Shawn King hopes to be the answer to the question left by departed starter Caleb Green. King must provide the points and rebounds left by Green, last season Mid-Con conference Player of the Year. Against SW Oklahoma, King stepped up to the challenge with 20 points and six boards in just 19 minutes. His problem, however, is fouls. Against A&M's frontcourt, he'll have trouble staying on the court.	2

Only about 30 % of all shark species are oviparous, i.e. lay eggs - like, e.g., turtles – and leave the young, which will hatch some time later, to themselves. In the laid egg of the catshark, the tiny animal and the comparatively huge yolk are clearly visibly. Shortly before the shark hatches, the yolk supply has declined and the animal has grown a lot.	1

Preen Vegetable Garden Weed Preventer is a great organic way to prevent weeds in fruit, vegetable, herb or landscape beds. Preen Vegetable Garden is a 100% organic corn gluten meal. Proteins in the corn gluten stop root formation in new seeds, killing the weed before they can sprout. It’s safe to use around any established edibles up to the day of harvest. Preen Vegetable Garden can be applied anytime of the season. For the best protection apply it early, and then reapply every 4 to 6 weeks.	1

Wie das Statistische Landesamt [Baden-Württemberg] jetzt beispielhaft für Stuttgart ermittelt hat, hatten 2011 noch 4800 Menschen zwischen 18 und 25 einen Pkw - 2000 waren es noch fast 13.000 (- 64 %). Im gleichen Zeitraum ist die Zahl der Jungen Leute dieser Altersklasse um 9 % gestiegen. Sogar der Gesamtbestand an privat zugelassenen Wagen ist in Stuttgart zwischen 2000 und 2011 um 8,1 % auf 219.000 gesunken. Parallel ergab eine Bürgerumfrage 2005 und 2011, dass in dieser Altersklasse der Anteil der VVS-Nahverkehrskunden sich von 59 auf 72 % erhöht hat.	1

Allows a wide range of people to contribute their thoughts. Collects an indication of transport needs from across the whole community. Information can be collected from a large number of people in a relatively short space of time. Allows individuals who have difficulty getting out and about to participate. Delivering paper questionnaires through existing delivery networks, such as parish newsletters is often the most cost effective. Other options include through the local newspaper, but they do not always have 100% coverage, or via the Royal Mail. Both of these will cost money.	1

PPG: 5.6 RPG: 2.8 3pt%: 41.5 Texas Tech continues to rotate starters in the front court, but senior forward Darryl Dora continues to get the most minutes and had the start against A&M in Tech's upset in Lubbock. In that game Dora scored nine points and pulled down four rebounds, but where he can be deadly is from behind the 3-point arc where not many big men can follow. Also, freshman Decensae White or sophomore Damir Suljagic could start here instead of Dora.	1

Over more than a century, Palestinian cultural heritage has been managed by several different administrations. Each of these has had its own methods of management, protection, research, and distinct political purpose, making Palestinian cultural heritage one of the most intensively abused, excavated and subsequently disturbed worldwide. In accordance with the Oslo Accords (1993-1995), the Palestinian Authority took over responsibility for archaeology in Areas “A” and “B”, representing about 40% of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In spite of this inequity, it was the first time that the Palestinian people were given an opportunity to manage their own heritage. This paper attempts to discuss these issues and their negative impact on archaeological sites in the Hebron district. Special attention will be given to the state of cultural heritage since the Oslo Accords, when Palestinian cultural heritage started being operated by two contested administrations: the Palestinian Department of Antiquities in areas “A and B”, and the Israeli Staff Officer for Archaeology in area “C”. Clandestine excavations, illicit trafficking and the state of conservation of Palestinian cultural heritage are also explored to demonstrate the protection, conservation and development dynamics of archaeological sites in this area and how this dually contested management tremendously affects safeguarding of the heritage in the Hebron area. Illegal Israeli excavations, so-called “salvage excavations”, and the devastating impact of the separation wall on archaeological sites and the cultural landscape are also briefly discussed.	1
