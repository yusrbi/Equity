IHSA Classes 2/3/4 The state series class which a school competes in not only depends on the school's student population, but on the sport or activity. Some activities divide schools into two classes, some into three, and others into four. The listing here is in the order of two class, three class, and four class. The more "A"s in a class, the larger the schools competing. For more information on this, see Illinois High School Association#State Series Format . Schools are not assigned a classification for football until they have qualified for the playoffs each year. A school's classification not only depends on their student population, but on the populations of the other schools who have qualified. Thus, some schools routinely move between classes.	2

Episode 1 Anonymised secrets (revealed to the audience to be about Kelly, Kamran and Anna) were selected randomly and read out loud.

Anna then claimed that she had lied during her interview, and that this was false.	1
