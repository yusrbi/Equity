Date -> dimension --> calendar date, [*date]
Time -> Dimension --> Time
Duration is not a dimension as it is measured in the time dimension and it is not a unit , thus it is a  measurement, it measures the elapsed time. I will add it to the measurement unit, with Monye_Value

Money
Currency --> dimension 
Money_value --> Measurement_unit
USD --> unit

Rational numbers
Fractions 1/3
Ratios 1:3
Rates --> exchange rates for currency, mortality rate, birth rate, etc [*SPACE*rate]
Frequency --> 1/time, cyclic event, dimension and measurement unit
Percentage  ->%
Change % -> +/- increase decrease

Identifiers --> dimension less, unit less
Serial numbers and orders  --> Dimension less 
scores/goals/ etc --> dimensionless
Count, like votes, is dimensionless and unit less 


This is about linking a column header to one of the dimensions/measures:
1- before matching the header to a general wikipedia concept check if it matches a dimension or a dimensionless measure (such as counts, serial no, rank,etc.).
2- This is different than unit detection as the unit is assigned to a single quantity but the dimension/measure will be assigned to the whole column
3- the dimension and the unit must accord, which will be imposed on the edge connecting them (candidate-candidate coherence)
4- A column will be mapped to a dimensionless measures iff no unit is specified in the column.
5- For statistical terms (such as Max,Min,Avg., mean, change, error, total,etc.) I will handel them as modifiers to the dimension/dimensionless measure. 

	
One table for the statistical modifiers
their aliases should be kept as well

for the units I will not change anything but for matching thr header I will change the following:
1- look for a dimension that matches the header -- using the approximate matches -- need to have an identifier 
2- Look for a dimensionless measure that matches the header --using the approximate matching -- need to have an identifier
3- Use regexpressions to match them to the following if any:

Count 
4- look for a match in the concepts list
