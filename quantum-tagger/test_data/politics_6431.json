This column assesses the dispute settlement system's capacity to bear a larger caseload and suggests that an increase in WTO litigation could be good news for the rules-based trading system \u2013 even in the absence of progress on the Doha round.\nA\nWhat do you get when you combine a sudden collapse in world trade, a global recession, a stalled round of multilateral negotiations, and a moderate-to-substantial increase in measurable protectionism? The answer, somewhat surprisingly, has been remarkably little trade friction \u2013 at least as measured by the number of trade disputes brought to the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement mechanism. The yearly totals for 2008 (19 new disputes) and 2009 (only 14 new disputes) are two of the five lowest on record in the WTO\u2019s 15-year history.\nIf and when an upswing in WTO disputes does return, would failure to progress on the Doha Round of negotiations raise the prominence of the WTO\u2019s judicial branch to a politically unsustainable level? Unlike the dysfunctional dispute settlement system GATT era, the WTO process is prepared to take on a much higher caseload of disputes. Furthermore, because the WTO\u2019s self-enforcing system lacks a police force and independent prosecutors, access to dispute settlement is important for all exporting economies. This access is especially critical for the WTO\u2019s developing economy members (Hoekman and Kostecki 2009).\nWTO dispute data: The continued importance to developing economies\nMost WTO disputes boil down to a simple issue \u2013 a group of exporting firms in one economy has lost (or failed to realise) sales to a foreign market that was \u201Cpromised\u201D when a trading partner took on an earlier WTO commitment.\nFigure 1 illustrates the total use of WTO dispute settlements over time. Most striking is a substantial drop-off in new cases starting around 2001. Combined, WTO members initiated an average of 41 new disputes per year during 1995-2000, but this number falls to fewer than 21 new disputes per year for 2001-2009. 1 This drop-off is almost entirely explained by changing use by the US and EU of the system. During 1995-2000, the US and EU combined to initiate one half of all WTO disputes, and half of those were cases launched against each other. Since 2001, these two economies have combined to initiate fewer than six disputes per year on average.\nFigure 1. WTO disputes initiated by year, 1995-2009\nSource: Compiled from the WTO\u2019s website. Disputes are broken down into bilateral (complainant\/respondent) pairs. Because some disputes involved more than one complainant, the 402 requests for consultations initiated over the 1995-2009 period yielded 429 bilaterally paired disputes.\nDeveloping country use of WTO dispute settlement is much steadier over time at more than 10 new disputes per year during 2001-2009, down only slightly from an average of 13 cases per year during 1995-2000. Increasingly these cases involve challenging other developing economies. While China has yet to file a dispute against another developing economy, four recent disputes filed against China have included challenges by developing economies like Mexico (three times) and Guatemala (once). 2\nThe relative increase in developing country use of WTO dispute settlement to resolve their differences is good news. It is evidence that developing economies are increasingly invested in the multilateral, rules-based WTO system.\nThe lingering perception that disputes are bad is wrong\nThe idea that an international organisation staffed by unelected bureaucrats with limited public accountability having power to interpret the WTO contract through legal rulings makes many understandably nervous. The decision by the EU and US to use WTO dispute settlement to resolve a number of politically sensitive trans-Atlantic issues during the immediate post-Uruguay Round period (1995-2000) (bananas, beef hormones, foreign sales corporations, and the Byrd Amendment, among others) greatly raised the public profile of the system. Politicians in the US (if the EU was the complainant) or Europe (if the US was complainant) raised concerns that the WTO was threatening national sovereignty by forcing countries to take on obligations through judicial rulings instead of multilateral negotiations. However, the high volume of politically sensitive cases brought against the US and EU from 1995-2000 did not bring down the system because the US and EU adeptly managed the political problem of \u201Closing\u201D many WTO disputes by initiating and \u201Cwinning\u201D just as many cases as complainant. All that was necessary to silence a domestic critic complaining that the WTO threatened national sovereignty was to point out the larger set of benefits deriving from the other side of the ledger.\nDispute settlement under the WTO has experienced growing pains and legitimate debates about the substance of particular WTO legal rulings. Legal scholars and academic economists have provided substantial critical commentary on the evolving WTO jurisprudence. 3 Nevertheless, it is also fair to say that most WTO decisions have been quite narrow. Panels and the Appellate Body have been sympathetic to concerns about judicial activism, and they frequently invoke the principal of \u201Cjudicial economy\u201D by refusing to rule on many issues the parties raise in a case.\nA lesson from this era is that a politically acceptable future of WTO dispute settlement is not necessarily tied to the number of cases being pursued. Even under a scenario of a failed Doha Round, a high volume of WTO disputes can be sustained politically if the involved countries manage a political \"balance\" of offensive and defensive cases. Just as history has shown that trade negotiations require a balance of market opening initiatives across countries to conclude a politically and economically palatable round, what matters for the WTO\u2019s judicial branch is that individual countries manage a reciprocal balance of ongoing disputes.\nReciprocal WTO dispute settlement in action\nAn example of a reciprocal balance of WTO disputes is currently taking place between the EU and China over two different varieties of the same product \u2013 iron and steel fasteners. 4 As background, the EU initiated an antidumping investigation over Chinese fastener exports in 2007 and imposed new duties of up to 85% in January 2009. China responded by initiating its own antidumping investigation over EU exports of a different variety of fasteners in 2008, and it imposed new 25% tariffs.\nWithout WTO dispute settlement, a tit-for-tat exchange of trade retaliation might have emerged. Instead, in July 2009, China filed a WTO dispute seeking to have its access to the EU iron and steel fastener market restored. In May 2010, the EU responded by initiating its own WTO dispute against the Chinese antidumping duties, seeking restored access for its exporters to the Chinese market.\nIn this light, WTO dispute settlement provides an opportunity for these two economies to unwind trade barriers and reciprocally open up each other\u2019s markets for these products. Doing so relies on the same principles and economic tradeoffs that negotiators relied on during the market-opening GATT rounds of 1947-1994 although in this case the market opening is simply on a smaller scale.\nDeveloping economies and the importance of even small-scale disputes\nThe media-headlining US and EU cases of the 1990s provide a distorted picture of WTO dispute settlement. The typical dispute is much less politically charged. The example of EU and Chinese challenges to imposed antidumping measures are much more typical, especially for cases initiated by developing economies.\nDeveloping economies now face a much lower cost to litigating and getting advice on WTO dispute settlement through access to the Advisory Centre on WTO Law, a Geneva-based legal assistance provider that offers developing economies access to high quality subsidised legal services. It has assisted developing economies in more than 30 formal disputes.\nMany of these cases are small. Table 1 identifies a number of South-South disputes in which the alleged WTO-infraction wiped out less than $10 million in annual export revenue. Examples include Argentina initiating a dispute against Peru, Turkey filing against South Africa, Bangladesh challenging India, Pakistan targeting Egypt, and Guatemala taking on Mexico.\nTable 1.
