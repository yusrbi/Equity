We also held extensive discussions with former employees of Big Data companies to further calibrate our models.\nInformation types used to estimate revenue of private Big Data vendors included supply-side data collection, number of employees, number of customers, size of average customer engagement, amount of venture capital raised, and age of vendor.\nBig Data Definitions\nIt is critically important to understand how Wikibon defines Big Data as it relates to the market size overall and to revenue estimates for specific vendors in particular. Wikibon\u2019s definition of Big Data contains two equally important parts.\nFirst, from a technology perspective, Wikibon defines Big Data as those data sets whose size, type, and speed-of-creation make them impractical to process and analyze with traditional database technologies and related tools in a cost- or time-effective way.\nSecond, Wikibon believes Big Data requires practitioners to embrace an exploratory and experimental mindset regarding data and analytics, one that replaces gut instinct with data-driven decision-making, and exchanges stubbornness for a willingness to question long-held assumptions. Projects whose processes are informed by this mindset meet Wikibon\u2019s definition of Big Data, even in cases where some of the tools and technology involved may not.\nBased on the above definition, Wikibon includes the following products and services under the umbrella of Big Data:\nHadoop software and related hardware;\nNoSQL database software and related hardware;\nNext-generation data warehouses\/analytic database software and related hardware;\nNon-Hadoop Big Data platforms, software, and related hardware;\nIn-memory \u2013 both DRAM and flash \u2013 databases as applied to Big Data workloads;\nData integration and data quality platforms and tools as applied to Big Data deployments;\nAdvanced analytics and data science platforms and tools;\nApplication development platforms and tools as applied to Big Data use cases;\nBusiness intelligence and data visualization platforms and tools as applied to Big Data use cases;\nAnalytic and transactional applications as applied to Big Data use cases;\nBig Data support, training, and professional services.\nKey Findings: 2012 Big Data Market Highlights and Trends\nFollowing are key findings, market highlights and trends for the Big Data market in 2012.\nMarket-leader IBM offers by far the largest product and services portfolio by both breadth and depth. The company also supports its Big Data practice with a well-crafted, high-level marketing campaign focused around its Smarter Planet initiative that often includes illustrations of real-world Big Data deployments. The biggest criticism of IBM from practitioners is that the company\u2019s portfolio is so wide and deep it causes confusion. IBM combats this confusion by initiating many Big Data customer engagements through its professional services division. A challenge and area of focus for IBM moving forward is to continue to articulate its Big Data vision in a way that focuses on industry solutions and not point products.\nHP achieved second-place status in the overall Big Data market by revenue in 2012. It did so mostly thanks to revenue derived from Big Data-related services, followed by sales of hardware to support Big Data deployments. HP by its sheer size is in a position to impact and participate in a number of Big Data deployments.\nProfessional services was the largest segment of the Big Data market in 2012. Among firms that derive 100% of their Big Data revenue from professional and\/or cloud-based services, which accounts for 44% of the overall Big Data market, the leader by total Big Data revenue was Accenture with $194 million. Consolidated across vendors, professional and cloud services revenue accounted for $5 billion of total 2012 Big Data revenue.\nAmazon continued and Google kicked off increasingly aggressive moves into the Big Data market. Each introduced new products and services to allow enterprises to leverage Big Data analytics and storage-as-a-service with the usual benefits associated with public Cloud services (elasticity, pay-by-the-drink, trading upfront CAPEX for monthly OPEX, etc.) Specifically, Amazon introduced RedShift, an analytic-database-as-a-service, to its portfolio and struck a deal with MapR to allow customers to run its Hadoop distribution on Amazon Web Service, among other announcements. Amazon also continued to build its Elastic MapReduce business. Google finally got into the Big Data game by productizing Big Data tools and technologies, such as BigQuery, it has long used internally, and likewise introduced MapR as a service via Google Compute Engine.\nWhile M&A activity was relatively tepid, two important acquisitions took place in 2012 that have the potential to impact the long-term Big Data market. The first was VMware\u2019s acquisition of analytics firm CETAS. VMware had already begun efforts to apply virtualization technology to Hadoop, and the acquisition of CETAS gives the vendor a more comprehensive Big Data portfolio. The creation of the Pivotal Initiative further indicates that VMware and EMC are continuing to invest in Big Data for the long-term.\nThe second deal worth noting was WANdisco\u2019s acquisition of Hadoop provider AltoStor. WANdisco specializes in data replication across the WAN, which it applies to Hadoop (both its own distribution as well as Cloudera\u2019s and Hortonworks\u2019 distributions) with the aim of making the open source Big Data framework reliable enough to support mission critical applications.\nMicrosoft officially entered the Hadoop market in 2012 with the release of an on-premise Hadoop product - HDInsight Server for Windows \u2013 and a cloud-based Hadoop service - Windows Azure HDInsight Service. Both are based on Hortonworks\u2019 open source Hadoop distribution. Microsoft also announced PolyBase, which aims to allow the SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse to execute SQL queries against data stored in Hadoop.\nA movement to bring SQL and NoSQL together in a unified platform was firmly established in 2012. Hadapt and Teradata Aster, which kicked off this movement in 2011 continued to lead the charge but were joined by competitors Cloudera, Microsoft and others in 2012.\nFacebook, Google, and Amazon as well several three-letter government agencies continued to invest heavily in commodity hardware to build out massive internal Big Data infrastructures. Facebook alone spent close to $800 million on infrastructure in just three quarters in 2012. This spending is reflected in Big Data revenue for the original device manufacturer (ODM) category that appears at the bottom of the table. Specifically, Facebook and others like it purchase, configure, and deploy off-the-shelf hardware from ODM\u2019s such as Quanta, rather then purchasing commodity machines from vendors such as Dell or HP, to support the majority of their operations.\nSpotlight on Hadoop and NoSQL Market Sub-Segment\nAs mentioned in the introduction of this report, Hadoop-related software and services matured rapidly in 2012, leading to increased adoption of enterprise-level products by companies in industries beyond the Web. In many cases, companies that had previously deployed community (read: free) versions of vendor Big Data software bundles for proof-of-concept projects began upgrading to paid software and services to support production-level deployments.\nAs a result, leading Hadoop distribution vendors Cloudera and MapR enjoyed significant revenue growth last year. Cloudera grew revenue to $56 million in 2012 from $18 million in 2011. MapR grew revenue to $23 million in 2012 from $7 million in 2011. Hortonworks, in its first full year of existence, did $18 million in revenue in 2012.\nLikewise, in the related NoSQL space a handful of vendors that offer commercial versions of popular open source databases enjoyed significant revenue growth as pilot projects blossomed into production deployments supporting real-time, Web-scale applications and services.\nAmong these vendors is 10gen, which offers a commercial version of the open source, document-oriented MongoDB; Aerospike, whose NoSQL database supports very low-latency online transactional applications; and DataStax, the company behind commercial Cassandra that counts Netflix among its marquee customers.\nLeading the way in terms of revenue in the Hadoop\/NoSQL subsegment of the Big Data market in 2012 was a 10-year-old firm, MarkLogic. The company\u2019s NoSQL document store is in use at Bank Of America, the Defense Intelligence Agency and Warner Brothers, among other household names in the media and financial services industries.\nUltimately, however, the NoSQL market is largely up for grabs. Each NoSQL database has its related strengths and weaknesses, and no one NoSQL database currently \u201Cdoes it all.\u201D Big Data practitioners must take a number of factors into consideration when selecting a NoSQL database to facilitate large-scale transactional workloads, including scalability, performance, security, and ease-of-development.\nBelow is a cut out of Big Data revenue associated with those vendors specializing in Hadoop and NoSQL software and services. Note that these vendors account for total Big Data revenue of $272 million and are growing at a faster percentage rate than the rest of the Big Data market.\nFigure 1 - Source: Wikibon 2013\nBig Data Revenue by Market Segment\nBelow is a segmentation of the Big Data market by hardware, software and services.\nFigure 2 - Source: Wikibon 2013\nWikibon further dissected Big Data revenue by type down to a more granular level.\nFigure 3 - Source: Wikibon 2013; *Big Data infrastructure software includes Hadoop, data integration, data quality and other data management software.\nWikibon\u2019s Big Data Forecast\nWikibon projects the Big Data market to top $18 billion in 2013, a growth rate of 61%. Looking beyond 2013, Wikibon forecasts the total Big Data market to approach $50 billion by 2017, which translates to a 31% compound annual growth rate over the five-year period 2012-2017. While the global economic outlook is for slow to stagnant growth over this period, Wikibon believes the Big Data market will not be severely impacted and may, in fact, benefit from enterprises needing \u201Cto do more with less,\u201D which effective Big Data analytics facilitates.\nWikibon further expects the balance of revenue generation and value to shift from Big Data infrastructure and middleware to value-add services and software over the next five years. As noted, hardware revenue accounts for 37% of Big Data revenue and a large portion of software and services revenue is associated with infrastructure software and technical services that tie Big Data platforms and data together.\nWikibon believes Big Data infrastructure, middleware, and technical services will become increasingly commoditized as they mature and common standards are adopted. Practitioners will increasingly look to NoSQL and in-memory database software, streaming analytic platforms, vertically focused analytical and transactional applications and application development platforms (both on-premise and Cloud-based) and associated consulting and professional services to address specific, high-value business problems and opportunities.\nBelow is Wikibon\u2019s Big Data market forecast broken down by market component through 2017.\nFigure 4 - Source: Wikibon 2013\nWikibon will be looking in more detail at the components that make up the Big Data market, shown in Figure 4. For additional analysis of components of this forecast, see Big Data Database Revenue and Market Forecast 2012-2017 for an examination of SQL\/NoSQL and 2012 Big Data Revenue by Vendor for a breakdown by segments.\nAction Item: While Big Data vendor revenue is forecast to grow significantly over the next five years, Wikibon believes that Big Data practitioners will create much more value than technology and service providers in the long-term. When selecting vendors to support Big Data initiatives, therefore, CIOs and Big Data practitioners must evaluate the products and services on offer in the context of how best to monetize Big Data to achieve competitive advantage. This includes evaluating \u201Cspeeds and feeds\u201D and other product features but should also include evaluating how well vendors can assist enterprises in adopting a sustainable culture of data-driven decision-making.\nMelbourne Seo Services | Melbourne Web Developer\nFootnotes: (a) Wikibon revised its 2011 Big Data market size estimate to $7.2 billion from $5.1 billion. Upon further review and extensive feedback from the Wikibon community, it was decided that the original figure underestimated the level of revenue generated by original device manufacturers.\ncategories\n","title":"Big Data Vendor Revenue And Market Forecast 2012-2017 - ...","url":" http:\/\/wikibon.org\/wiki\/v\/Big_Data_Vendor_Revenue_and_Market_Forecast_2012-2017","page_title":"Big Data Vendor Revenue And Market Forecast 2012-2017 - Wikibon"}
