In many cases, however, contract terms are modified through direct negotiations in which the ministry has substantial discretion.\nThe fiscal regime varies by region. Outside Kurdistan, companies sign service contracts in which they agree to pay the central government a fee per barrel produced. The State Oil Marketing Organization sells the oil and deposits revenues in the national treasury. In Kurdistan, however, production sharing contracts are used and the resulting revenues are not necessarily remitted to the central government.\nIraq requires environmental impact assessments prior to project implementation, which are published by the Environment Ministry. There is no freedom of information act. Iraq has been an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliant country since December 2012.\nReporting Practices (Rank: 24th\/58, Score: 52\/100) learn more\nIraq received a \"partial\" score of 52, the result of incomplete disclosure on most revenue indicators.\nThe Oil Ministry publishes some contract information, including the amount of money per barrel that an operating company receives, but does not provide details on how contracts may have changed in post-bidding negotiations. Kurdistan authorities disclose little information about their licensing process; they generally publish the resulting production sharing agreements, but these do not always include signature bonuses and other key provisions.\nThe Oil Ministry publishes information on reserves, production volumes, prices, exports, companies operating in the country, and production stream values. The Finance Ministry publishes information on prices and monthly reports on the value of oil exports, as does the central bank. Iraq's first EITI report covers 2009 and includes company-by-company production data as well as information included in the Oil Ministry's reports.\nSafeguards & Quality Controls (Rank: 22nd\/58, Score: 63\/100) learn more\nIraq earned a \"partial\" score of 63, highlighting uneven checks on the licensing process and inadequate audit requirements for state-owned companies.\nParliament receives copies of oil contracts and is responsible for monitoring the activities of the Oil Ministry, but does not appear to play a significant oversight role. There is a similar lack of legislative oversight of Kurdistan's oil industry.\nThe national audit office and an external independent auditor review oil revenues. Audit reports go to the parliament but are not published. Government officials with a role in the oil sector must disclose potential conflicts of interest.\nEnabling Environment (Rank: 51st\/58, Score: 9\/100) learn more\nIraq's \"failing\" score of 9 is its lowest on any component, reflecting an especially low ranking for the rule of law.\nState-Owned Companies (Rank: 24th\/45, Score: 45\/100) learn more\nNorth Oil, South Oil, Midland Oil, and Missan Oil function as operational units of the Oil Ministry. They publish information on reserves, production volumes and values, as well as monthly data on exports and prices. Audited financial reports are not available.\nSubnational Transfers (Rank: 9th\/30, Score: 79\/100) learn more\nMost revenue transfers from the central government to the provinces are calculated based on population rather than regional oil production, although there is a plan to expand the \"petro-dollar\" program currently implemented in Kirkuk, under which oil-producing provinces would receive $1 per barrel. The central government publishes some information on transfers in annual budget documents, as do provincial councils and the regional government of Kurdistan.\n","title":"Iraq | Natural Resource Governance Institute","url":" http:\/\/www.resourcegovernance.org\/countries\/middle-east-and-north-africa\/iraq\/overview","page_title":"Iraq | Natural Resource Governance Institute"}
