AMF told us that interviewers are asked to observe whether nets are hung by entering interviewees' houses (rather than simply asking interviewees if they are hung). 59\nVery good condition: LLIN has fewer than 2 holes of less than 2 cm in size. 60\nOK condition: LLIN has fewer than 10 small holes. 61\nPoor condition: LLIN has more than 10 small holes or has one or more large holes. 62\nWorn out: Survey reports from Concern Universal did not provide a definition of this term. AMF told us that an LLIN is considered worn out if it has multiple large holes and the LLIN is unrepairable, such that it would not provide protection against mosquitos. 63\nUsed correctly: According to a survey form from 2012, interviewers are asked to \"ask the householder to demonstrate how the nets are used at night\" and to then select yes or no to the question \"are the nets being used correctly.\" 64 AMF told us that the procedure has not changed in more recent surveys. 65\n79% of individuals in households that received LLINs sleeping under a useable LLIN (at 24-month follow up in Ntcheu) is roughly in line with usage rates of the trials of bednet efficacy documented in our page on Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets , in which small-scale studies of bednet efficacy had net usage rates generally in the 60%-80% range. 66\nThe \"decay model\" we use to anticipate the lifespan of LLINs assumes that 80% of LLINs are effective at 24 months. 67 AMF found that 77% LLINs in Ntcheu were in \"very good\" or \"OK\" condition at 24 months. LLINs appear to have decayed more quickly in Balaka, where 70% of nets were in \"very good\" condition at 6-months (and 25% in \"OK\" condition), compared with 99% in \"very good\" condition at 6-months in Ntcheu. It is not clear to us whether these rates of decay are comparable to the assumptions in the decay model, in part because it is not clear whether the definitions of useable are similar in the model and AMF's data. We may do further analysis to more directly compare the model and AMF's data in the future.\nDo AMF's LLINs increase the total number of LLINs distributed, or would the recipients have received LLINs from other sources if not for AMF?\nFor the Ntcheu 2012 distribution in Malawi, AMF received data from the National Malaria Control Program on population figures and LLINs already distributed by district, as well as LLINs that had been committed to the country by other funders. AMF estimated, in September 2011, that an additional 909,586 nets were needed to achieve universal coverage in the country, 68 of which AMF contributed 268,240. 69 We have not done a similar analysis for later distributions.\nWe would guess that AMF is increasing the total number of LLINs because, across Africa, there are substantial funding gaps for LLINs (more below ) and because our impression from following AMF's progress over time is that, due to AMF's more limited funding and, perhaps, greater data requirements, governments often seek funding first from larger funders (particularly the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria) and then may ask AMF to fill gaps. However, we have low confidence in this guess, and note that countries are able to choose how they allocate Global Fund grants among malaria interventions (including LLINs, treatment, and diagnosis), so the availability of funding for LLINs from AMF could cause countries to allocate less Global Fund resources to LLINs.\nPossible negative or offsetting impact\nDo donated nets displace government health funding? This could be a concern if government funding that otherwise would have been spent on LLINs is spent on other, less worthwhile budget items. We have little sense of how important a concern this is in AMF's case. In the case of the 2012 distribution in Malawi, all anticipated nets were expected from international donors, and the total supply appeared to be still insufficient for country-wide universal coverage. 70\nWill insecticide-treated nets continue to be effective? As discussed at our report on insecticide-treated nets , there is strong evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention, however the best evidence for the intervention was collected before LLINs were widely used and there is some evidence that mosquitoes have since adapted to the insecticide used in LLINs, possibly making them less effective. In 2012 we reviewed the evidence on the state of insecticide resistance . We concluded, \"We're very concerned about insecticide resistance. It appears that relatively little is known about the extent, causes, and control implications of resistance; that resistance could substantially affect (or even negate) the effectiveness of malaria control\u2026 That said, this issue doesn't change our bottom line that LLIN distribution is a highly cost-effective intervention\u2026 There is strong evidence that LLINs reduce malaria and save lives and only preliminary\/suggestive\/mixed evidence that insecticide resistance may reduce their impact.\"\nDo free LLIN distributions distort incentives for recipients or distort local markets for nets? As discussed at our report on insecticide-treated nets , we feel that there is a reasonably strong case for distributing LLINs freely rather than selling them at market (or even below-market) prices.\nCould distribution of LLINs be inequitable and unfair, causing problems in the targeted communities? We feel that AMF's process for determining needs for LLINs at the household level is well-suited to ensuring that all who want LLINs receive them.\nDoes AMF divert skilled labor from other areas? Net distribution is conducted by low-level government health staff in partnership with the staff of AMF's partner NGO. 71 According to AMF's partner in Malawi, government health staff are normally involved in activities such as disseminating health-related information, reporting on levels of stunting and disease, carrying out immunization campaigns, and providing nutrition support. 72 We don't know the extent to which net distribution reduces their ability to complete other duties, though we note that net distributions are generally completed within a few days in each local area.\nWhat do you get for your dollar?\nCost per LLIN distributed\nEstimate based on data from AMF\nUsing budgets and estimates provided by AMF, we estimate that the total cost to purchase, distribute and follow up on the distribution of an AMF-funded LLIN is about $5.30 in Malawi and very roughly $7.50 in DRC. We focus on these two countries because they are where AMF has completed recent distributions or is planning distributions.\nNote that we prefer to include all costs incurred to carry out a project, not just those that the charity in question pays for itself. We believe that this gives the best view of what it costs to achieve a particular impact (such as saving a life), and also avoids the lack of clarity and complications of leverage in charity . Our estimate of the cost to distribute an AMF-funded LLIN aims to include both costs AMF pays and costs paid by others.\nFull details in this spreadsheet .\nThe estimate for Malawi uses:\nThe purchase price per LLIN, calculated from AMF's total LLIN budget and the number of LLINs distributed.\nActual costs for the distribution and 6-month follow-up survey in Balaka, as reported by Concern Universal, budgeted costs for later follow-up surveys in Balaka, and budgeted costs for all of the non-net costs for the Dedza (2014) and Dowa (2015) distributions. 73 AMF told us that the non-net budget includes all monetary costs incurred by Concern Universal, as well as the use of vehicles and managerial staff time; 74 it may exclude non-monetary costs such as use of office space.\nAn estimate of non-monetary costs incurred by Concern Universal and local governments, based on estimates provided in 2012 by Concern Universal for its distribution in Ntcheu province. 75\nAn estimate of AMF's organizational costs per net, including an estimate of the value of donated services and volunteer time. Because these costs generally do not vary with the number of LLINs distributed and remain roughly constant on a per year basis, the per LLIN estimate is highly dependent on the time period used and the number of LLINs distributed in that period. We estimate AMF's organizational costs as $0.82 per LLIN for 2013-2015. This estimate assumes that AMF will complete the distributions it currently plans for that period and does not account for any additional distributions. 76\nWe shared our analysis with AMF before publishing and AMF wrote the following in response.\nResponse from AMF: Using actual costs to assess cost effectiveness\nThe AMF view is it more relevant to its donors to look at AMF\u2019s actual costs when calculating its cost-effectiveness, rather than adding in costs where either no cash cost exits or support is provided pro bono.\nThis matters as not to do so distorts cost-effectiveness figures. AMF\u2019s overhead costs per annum are $120,000. Using this figure the cost per delivered and monitored net would be $4.80.\nGiveWell uses an overhead figure of $300,000 due to adding in a CEO salary of $100,000 (AMF\u2019s CEO does not draw a salary) and $80,000 of other overhead costs for services provided pro bono to AMF and therefore where no cash cost exists (the organisations providing pro bono support are very happy to work for no immediate financial return since they benefit in other ways from their involvement, e.g. in improved staff morale. This means they incur no net cost from providing the pro bono service).\nAs a result, GiveWell calculates the cost per net for AMF at about $5.30.\nGiveWell has calculated the cost per net for other organisations as $5.80.\nAt $5.30 per net, AMF is 9% more cost-effective than other organisations. At $4.80 per net, 17% more effective. That is a material difference.\nWe believe our donors are more interested in a comparison derived from AMF\u2019s actual costs rather than penalising it (reducing its assessed effectiveness) by not considering the no-cost and pro bono cost savings they may achieve. AMF as an organisation will continue to seek pro bono support believing this is more cost effective than paying for services.\nFor DRC, the estimate is much rougher. It is based on costs from the Kasaï Occidental (2014) distribution, specifically:\nThe purchase price per LLIN, calculated from AMF's total LLIN budget and the number of LLINs distributed.\nAn estimate of shipping costs. We do not have an estimate of shipping costs for this distribution, so we have used a rough estimate based on the Nord Ubangi 2015 distribution (also in DRC).\nAn estimate of pre-distribution and distribution costs from incomplete data from AMF's distribution partner IMA World Health. This estimate is 2.5 times as high as the Malawi estimate. This may be explained by a considerably more difficult operating environment in DRC, 77 or our data for DRC may simply be of lower quality.\nWe do not have data for the cost of follow-up surveys in DRC. We have assumed that the cost of these surveys will be about 2.5 times as expensive as in Balaka, consistent with our estimate of the increased costs to distribute LLINs in DRC.\nWe have used the same estimate of AMF organizational costs as we used for Malawi.\nGlobal estimate\nThe Roll Back Malaria Partnership, which estimates funding gaps for LLINs across all African countries, 78 uses an estimate of $3.30 to purchase a LLIN and $2.50 for all non-net costs of a distribution, for a total of $5.80 per LLIN. 79 This assumption is used in cases where country-specific data is not available. The Co-Chair of the Roll Back Malaria Harmonization Working Group told us that non-net costs can vary significantly by country and that non-net costs in DRC may be more than $5 per LLIN. 80 We have little information on how reliable this estimate is likely to be. Broadly, this estimate is consistent with the data we have seen from AMF. We have used estimates based on data from AMF in our cost per life saved calculations, because we have more information on their reliability.\nCost per life saved\nUsing $5.30 as the total cost per net in Malawi and $7.50 for DRC, we estimate the cost per child life saved through an AMF-funded LLIN distribution at about $3,340. 81\nThis does not include other potential benefits of LLINs (non-fatal cases of malaria prevented, prevention of deaths in age groups other than under-5 year olds, prevention of other mosquito-borne diseases, etc.). Full details at our report on mass distribution of LLINs .\nAs a general note on the limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally , due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible.\nRoom for more funds?\nIn November 2013, we wrote, in this blog post , that we believed AMF did not have room for more funding because it had raised over $10.6 million due to GiveWell's recommendation since 2011 and had not spent the bulk of these funds. Since then AMF has completed or signed agreements for several large distributions and we now believe that AMF has room for more funding in the next year. This change is primarily due to:\nA year ago, AMF had completed two large-scale distributions, both of which were with a single distribution partner, Concern Universal in Malawi. It had not signed agreements with other partners. As of November 2014, AMF has signed agreements for two large distributions with IMA World Health in the DRC (one of which is in progress), helping to demonstrate its ability to finalize distributions with other partners in other locations.\nAMF has spent or committed a large portion of the funds it raised prior to 2014. As of November 2014, AMF held $4.9 million in uncommitted funds, of which it raised $2.65 million in 2014. Of committed funds, $1.9 million are for expenses that AMF will incur more than a year from now, and AMF might consider reallocating these funds in the near term with the expectation of raising enough to cover these commitments by the time they are due. This brings the total available funds to $6.8 million. 82\nAMF's pipeline for potential distributions includes several distributions with established partners. Given AMF's history with these partners, we would guess that there are fewer barriers to signing agreements for additional distributions. Funding all such distributions would require AMF to raise significantly more funds. AMF may also have opportunities to fund distributions with new partners.\nThough we now have increased confidence in AMF's ability to finalize large distributions, there is still significant uncertainty as to its ability to find new partners and countries to work with. To find a sufficiently large distribution often requires negotiating with the national malaria control programs of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which we perceive to have some discretion in which funders they work with, and which we perceive to be choosing funders based on a variety of factors including size and reporting requirements. Because AMF is able to fund only a relatively small piece of a given country\u2019s distribution, but has substantial reporting requirements, there may be fundamental reasons for governments to prefer other funders. We believe that this is the most important and fundamental explanation for AMF's difficulties in finalizing distributions in the past. We believe that other factors may have also played a role. We discuss this topic in detail in this blog post.\nAMF told us that it is not in conversations with any major funders to help fill its funding gap. 83\nPipeline of potential distributions\nAs of November 2014, AMF was considering four main types of potential distributions:\nAdditional distributions with existing distribution partners. Due to ongoing relationships and probable need for additional LLINs, we believe that it is likely that AMF will have opportunities to fund additional distributions with these groups. AMF is considering funding up to $17.2 million worth of LLINs in 2015.\nMalawi will be carrying out a nationwide LLIN distribution in 2015 and may need additional LLINs. 84 AMF is considering funding 600,000 to 1 million LLINs 85 for Concern Universal to distribute in this additional district. This would likely cost $2.4-4.0 million, 86 including non-net costs (we assume AMF will fund non-net costs as it has for recent Concern Universal distributions).\nAMF is considering two potential distributions in DRC, where it believes there is a significant funding gap for LLINs in 2015. One distribution would be for 1 to 2 million LLINs and the other would be for 3 million LLINs. 87 Purchasing 4 million LLINs and paying for shipping (as AMF has agreed to do for its distribution with IMA in early 2015) would cost about $13.2 million. 88\nDistributions of moderate size (60,000 to 100,000 LLINs) in three other countries. AMF is considering funding 60,000 LLINs in one country and 100,000 LLINs in two other countries, 89 for a total cost of about $780,000. 90 AMF told us that it would be able to sign agreements for these distributions quickly if it chose to do so and that the reason it has not is because it expects to use its funds for larger distributions instead. If it is unable to sign agreements for larger distributions, it may go ahead with these more moderately sized ones. It will likely agree to fund the distribution for 60,000 LLINs because the distribution would involve a pilot project to test the use of smartphone technology for tracking LLIN distributions, which AMF is interested in learning more about. 91\nLarge distributions (1-4 million LLINs) in 2-3 other countries. AMF is in fairly early stages of discussion with governments in two countries to fund 1 to 2 million LLINs ($3-6 million) and up to 4 million LLINs ($12 million), respectively, in 2015. 92 AMF does not expect to pay for non-net costs in these countries. 93 More speculatively, there may be an opportunity for AMF to fund up to 2 million LLINs in a third country in 2015 and up to 2 million more in 2016-2017. 94 AMF has not yet begun conversations with the government of the third country. 95\nFunding research on insecticide resistance. AMF is considering spending approximately $300,000 over three years to fund a UK university to study insecticide resistance in conjunction with AMF's distribution in Nord Ubangi, DRC in 2015. It may also fund a similar project for its Dowa, Malawi distribution in 2015, at a cost of approximately $200,000. This research would (a) establish baseline rates of mosquito susceptibility to the insecticide used on most LLINs and (b) compare the effectiveness of LLINs used in most distributions and a newer type of LLIN that is more expensive but may be more effective at killing mosquitoes. 96\nIf AMF were able to finalize all of the distributions in its pipeline, with the exception of the speculative distribution for 4 million LLINs and the moderately-sized distributions (which it would likely drop in favor of the larger ones), it would need nearly $36 million. 97 We believe it is unlikely that all discussions would be successful. AMF currently holds approximately $6.8 million in funds it could allocate to future distributions. We believe AMF could conceivably absorb as much as $25 million more in the next year.  Considering AMF\u2019s track record of finalizing distributions and the past scale of its operations, we hope to see AMF receive an additional $10 million. We note that distributions can take over a year to plan 98 and funding that AMF receives in the next year may not be used or committed in that year. We expect to continue to follow AMF's progress of building a track record of finalizing and carrying out distributions over the next year.\nEffect of additional funds\nAMF has told us that the number of opportunities it considers at one time is limited by its funds and that the effect of having additional funds is largely to increase the size of the distributions it considers, rather than increasing the number of distributions it considered. The type of opportunities it will consider depends on how much funding it has available. If it were to raise an additional $10 million in the next year, it would likely continue to primarily consider distributions of 1 to 2 million LLINs. At this size, the failure of one or two negotiations would leave AMF with other possibilities in its pipeline, but the distribution size is still large enough to attract the interest of the type of partner AMF would like to work with. Above $10 million in additional funds, AMF would be able to increase the size of the distributions it considers. Above $20 million additional funds, AMF would primarily consider distributions of about 5 million LLINs, which would give it more leverage in its negotiations and discretion over which partners to work with. AMF told us that it has had several conversations about potential distributions that have not moved forward because AMF was unable to consider a distribution of sufficient size. 99 We do not have more details on these conversations, particularly on whether other issues contributed to the discussions not going forward.\nGlobal funding gaps for LLINs\nThe Roll Back Malaria Partnership's Harmonization Working Group estimates funding gaps for LLINs across all African countries. 100 It most recently published a gap analysis in September 2013. At that time, it estimated that about 390 million additional LLINs would be needed in 2013-2016. 101 In May and October 2014, we asked the Co-Chair of the Harmonization Working Group for updates on the size of the funding gap. On both occasions she told us that there remained significant gaps in funding for LLINs. She gave the following initial estimates for 2014-2017 (in millions of LLINs):\nCountry\n","title":"Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) | GiveWell","url":" http:\/\/www.givewell.org\/international\/top-charities\/AMF","page_title":"Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) | GiveWell"}
